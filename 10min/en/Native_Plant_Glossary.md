Native Plant Glossary 
Native Plant 
The official US Government definition is given by the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS). 
NRCS defines native plant as “A plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds 
or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a 
geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before 
European settlement are considered to be native to the United States.” 
 
Non-Native Plant 
A plant that was introduced with human help to a new place or new habitat, where it was not previously 
found. 
 
Naturalized Plant 
A non-native plant that does not need human help to maintain itself over time, in an area where it is not 
native. Naturalized plants are not native. 
 
Cultivar 
A plant that was selected, by plant breeders, for certain characteristics, that are maintained during 
propagation. 
• A cultivar does not come true to seed and needs continued human-mediated propagation to continue; 
• You can tell a cultivar by its scientific name which begins with its genus, followed by its species, and 
then its cultivar name in quotation marks. For example Ribes sanguineum ‘Oregon snowflake’ is a 
cultivar derived from the native Ribes sanguineum; and 
• Nativar is slang for a cultivar of a native plant. 
 
Hybrid  
A plant produced by crossing the genetic materials from two different species. They are not cultivars, but, you 
can have cultivars of a hybrid. 
• Lavandula x intermedia is a cross between Lavandula angustifolia (English lavender) and Lavandula 
latifolia (Portuguese lavender) 
• Lavandula x intermedia ‘Grosso’ and Lavandula x intermedia ‘Provence’ are two cultivars of Lavandula 
x intermedia 
 
Mutation 
Plant mutations, also known as sports or chimeras, are genetic changes that may affect the appearance of the 
foliage, flowers, fruit or stems. 
• Vegetative propagation is used to maintain desirable characteristics, plants are often prone to 
"reversion", meaning that part or all of the plant reverts to its original form.  
• Examples: Camelia flowers with specks and stripes

## Native Plant Glossary  

### Native Plant  
The official US Government definition is given by the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS). NRCS defines a native plant as:  
> “A plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States.”  

### Non-Native Plant  
A plant that was introduced with human help to a new place or new habitat, where it was not previously found.  

### Naturalized Plant  
A non-native plant that does not need human help to maintain itself over time, in an area where it is not native. Naturalized plants are not native.  

### Cultivar  
A plant that was selected, by plant breeders, for certain characteristics, that are maintained during propagation.  

- A cultivar does not come true to seed and needs continued human-mediated propagation to continue.  
- You can tell a cultivar by its scientific name which begins with its genus, followed by its species, and then its cultivar name in quotation marks. For example, *Ribes sanguineum ‘Oregon snowflake’* is a cultivar derived from the native *Ribes sanguineum*.  
- **Nativar** is slang for a cultivar of a native plant.  

### Hybrid  
A plant produced by crossing the genetic materials from two different species. They are not cultivars, but you can have cultivars of a hybrid.  

- *Lavandula x intermedia* is a cross between *Lavandula angustifolia* (English lavender) and *Lavandula latifolia* (Portuguese lavender).  
- *Lavandula x intermedia ‘Grosso’* and *Lavandula x intermedia ‘Provence’* are two cultivars of *Lavandula x intermedia*.  

### Mutation  
Plant mutations, also known as sports or chimeras, are genetic changes that may affect the appearance of the foliage, flowers, fruit, or stems.  

- Vegetative propagation is used to maintain desirable characteristics. Plants are often prone to "reversion," meaning that part or all of the plant reverts to its original form.  
- **Examples:** Camellia flowers with specks and stripes.

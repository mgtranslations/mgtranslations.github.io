Edible Landscaping 
Overview  
When people think about growing food in urban 
areas, the first idea is usually to hide the vegetable 
garden somewhere in the backyard.  
Edible landscaping offers an alternative to 
conventional residential landscapes; edible plants 
can be just as attractive while producing fruits and 
vegetables. One can install an entirely edible 
landscape or incorporate some edible plants into 
existing gardens.  
 
Definition 
Edible landscaping is the use of food-producing 
plants in the residential landscape.  It combines fruit 
and nut trees, berry bushes, vegetables, herbs, 
edible flowers, along with ornamental plants into 
aesthetically pleasing designs. These designs can 
adopt any garden style and may include anywhere 
from 1 to 100 percent edible specimens.  
 
Why Landscape with Edibles? 
•    Enjoy the freshness and flavor of home-grown,      
fully ripened fruits and vegetables.  
•    Control the quantity and kind of pesticides and 
herbicides used on the foods you consume.  
•    Increase the food security of your household.  
•    Save on grocery bills.  
•    Grow unusual varieties not available in stores.  
•    Get outside, interact with the natural world, and 
have fun. 
 
Things to Consider 
• Location  
Most fruits and vegetables require 6 to 8 hours of 
sun to produce well. Some of the native plants, such 
as salmonberry and thimbleberry, can take some 
shade, as can plants that have edible leaves, like 
lettuce and kale. 
• Space 
Be sure to think about the mature size of the plant.  
Dwarf or semi-dwarf trees and smaller-sized shrubs 
work well in small spaces.  Trellises, fences, and  
arbors make use of vertical space on which to grow 
edible trees, shrubs, and vines. 
• Time and Care 
Edibles require care at specific phases of their 
growth to remain productive.  They will require 
improved soil, careful watering and fertilizing at the 
right times, and vigilant management of diseases 
and insects.  This is especially true when the plants 
are young or just planted.   
• Use 
Know when to harvest, and be prepared to use the 
abundance from your garden. 
• Beauty 
Ornamental plants offer a wide range of flower 
color, foliage shape, texture and leaf color.  With a 
little research, it is possible to find edibles with the 
characteristics you value.  For example:  
1. Love the pink blossoms on a dogwood tree?  An 
apple tree has beautiful pink blossoms. 
2. Enjoy the shape and deep red color of the leaves 
on a Japanese maple?  Black elderberry has lacy, 
blackish leaves. 
3. Like the bright red fall color of burning bush?  
Blueberry bushes do the same. 
4. Yearn for the big-leaf hostas but don’t have 
enough shade?  Rhubarb plants add drama in a 
sunny location with big leaves.  
 
Short List of Edible Plants (* denotes native) 
• Small Trees  (10 to 20 feet) 
Apple:  Choose from semi-dwarf, espalier, and 
columnar forms; all have pretty pink blossoms in 
spring.  Varieties such as Chehalis, Jonafree, Liberty, 
Prima, and Redfree are resistant to scab.   
* Black Elderberry:  Lacy, blackish leaves are very 
attractive; fruit used for jelly, syrup, and wine. Good 
fire-resistant plant. 
Cherry:  Red or golden fruits in summer. Compact 
forms available for small spaces. Tendency toward 
diseases.  Also, birds like cherries, too! 
Fig:  Big, tropical looking leaves. Disease free. 
Pear: Asian and European—White flowers in early 
spring.  Asian pears tend not to have disease 
problems. 
Persimmon: Colorful orange fruits in the fall; no 
disease problems. 
Plum: Ripe fruits may be green, gold, red, or purple. 
Brooks and Italian varieties of European plums are 

easy to grow.  Brown rot is the most common 
problem. 
* Serviceberry: Clusters of white flowers in early 
spring; fall color is brilliant yellow to orange.  It is 
adaptable to a wide range of soil types and moisture. 
 
• Shrubs (woody, perennials, annuals; 3 to 10 feet)  
Blueberry: Beautiful fall color and abundant fruits in 
summer. Easy to grow and has very few disease 
problems. 
Currant and Gooseberry: Abundance of tart berries 
used in jams and jellies. Grow easily in medium to 
heavy soil and in a wide range of soil pH. 
*Evergreen huckleberry: Beautiful evergreen shrub 
with bronze-colored foliage. Likes part to full shade. 
Rhubarb: Large, interesting leaves and red stems. 
The leaves of rhubarb are poisonous; eat only the 
stocks. 
*Salmonberry: Ripe berries are bright orange to 
deep red. Naturalizes easily but needs to be 
controlled from spreading and taking over. 
Strawberry tree: Large, evergreen shrub with dark 
green glossy leaves and bright red fruit. Flowers in 
late fall to winter; best placed in a sheltered 
location. 
Tomato: Attractive, edible fruits in yellow, orange, 
red, green, purple, and black colors and in a wide 
range of shapes.  Grown as an annual for the 
summer months, tomatoes need sun and heat to 
mature.  Avoid overhead watering to discourage 
disease. 
 
• Vines and other climbers 
Grape (wine or seedless table grapes): Attractive 
foliage makes good summer shade over an arbor or 
patio. Need harsh annual pruning for good 
productivity. 
Kiwi (fuzzy and hardy kiwi): Exotic foliage, white 
flowers in May, and, in fall, fruit colors in green, red, 
and brown (colors in fall).  Most need a very sturdy 
structure to support vigorous growth. New, smaller, 
self-fertile varieties are available. 
Raspberry: Berries add beautiful color in the summer 
and fall.  Canes grow fast and fill in a sunny area in 
spring and summer.  Plant it in well-drained soil to 
avoid root rot. 
Marionberry: A blackberry that does not get out of 
control, developed at OSU.  A special technique is 
used to train berry canes onto wires. 
Cucumber: When allowed to climb, the cucumber 
flowers and fruit make a nice background plant. They 
get thirsty in hot weather and need plenty of water. 
Pole bean: Need full sun and good air circulation to 
avoid powdery mildew. Use in a children’s area to 
make teepees and tunnels. 
 
• Ground covers 
Strawberry:  White flowers in spring and red fruits in 
summer; strawberries are short lived and need to be 
replanted every 3 to 4 years. 
Lingonberry: Beautiful and delicate-looking 
evergreen ground cover. They will produce more 
fruit in full sun but will grow in part shade. 
Lettuce: Leaves range in color from red and green to 
blue, with a variety of forms. Lettuce may go to seed 
quickly in hot weather; sow seed every 2 weeks to 
have a continued supply. 
Kale: Lacy leaves in red, purple, green, and blue. 
Grows best from fall into winter; is a member of the 
cabbage family and can be attacked by flea beetles 
and cabbage moth. 
Swiss chard: Brightly colored varieties are the 
queens of edible ornamentals. Be aware that slugs 
enjoy Swiss chard, too.

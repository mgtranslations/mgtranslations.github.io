Gardening with Mulches 
Mulch is a layer of material spread over the soil surface to achieve one or more of the following benefits: 
• Reduce soil compaction from rain 
• Minimize soil erosion 
• Suppress weeds 
• Reduce spread of disease 
• Warm up the soil 
• Insulate the soil from extreme temperatures 
• Reduce evaporation and/or 
• Keep the soil moist 
 
Type  
• Organic mulches are made from materials that once lived.  Examples include sawdust, straw, yard 
debris, manure, and leaves. 
• Plastic mulch -- colors range from black, red and silver to clear. 
 
Organic Mulches  
Organic mulches will decompose over time, providing food for earthworms and other soil microbes.  If 
you apply organic mulch to the garden in the fall to prepare it for planting in the spring, you may use 
green, non-composted material. However, if you apply it shortly before planting in the spring, it is best 
to use composted material. Otherwise, as the mulch decomposes, it may compete with your plants for 
nutrients.  
 
When using straw, autumn leaves, or other organic materials that contain little nitrogen, add extra 
nitrogen fertilizer to help them decompose. Weed-free straw is a light-weight mulch but can be a fire 
hazard.  If you use grass clippings which contain a moderate level of nutrients as mulch, apply a layer 
that is thin enough to dry readily.  A layer that is too deep could turn slimy or form a dry crust which 
prevents water from penetrating.   
 
Spread a 2” to 4” layer of organic mulch on the soil surface around your plants; do not cover the plants 
or the crown of the plants.  At the end of the gardening season, organic mulches can be worked into the 
soil to improve its texture for the next planting season.  
 
How to Use Organic Mulches 
In the fall, remove diseased leaves and weeds from the garden, and then add a layer of organic mulch. 
This will keep weeds low during the winter and spring while protecting plant roots from freezing 
temperatures.   
In the spring, push mulch away from the plant to help the soil in the root zone warm up faster. 
In the summer, before temperatures climb, push the mulch back to cover the root zone. This will 
minimize evaporation and moderate changes in soil temperature. 
 
 

Reapply organic mulch as it breaks down to get all the benefits of mulching.  
 
Plastic Mulch  
Plastic mulch is often used to suppress weeds or to warm the soil.  A 3- to 5-foot wide strip of plastic 
mulch placed over the root zone of tomato plants can speed up the ripening by as many as 10 to 14 
days.  Plastic mulch reduces evaporation as well. Because ultra-violet light breaks down the plastic, 
replace it as needed. 
 
How to Use Plastic Mulch 
To suppress weeds: Lay black plastic after the soil is prepared for seeding or planting and after water 
lines have been placed. Weigh down the edges with soil.  Insert the seeds or transplants through an X 
cut in the plastic. Some plastics come perforated to allow water through, or you can use an ice pick to 
perforate the plastic. 
 
To warm the soil: Clear plastic and colored plastic that appears translucent warm the soil more than 
black plastic.  However, because they allow light to penetrate, they also can create a "greenhouse" for 
weeds under the plastic. Black plastic warms the soil to a lesser degree but also reduces weeds.   
 
To keep the soil dry: If you plan to work the soil early in the spring, you may cover the area with a large 
sheet of black plastic for the winter. It should keep that portion of the garden bed dry for very early soil 
preparation and planting. Be sure to weigh down the edges; otherwise, it can become a greenhouse for 
weeds and a hiding place for mice and rats.  
 
To accelerate growth and maturity of heat-loving plants: Tomato, pepper, melon, strawberry and other 
heat-loving plants have been subjects of numerous university studies across the country regarding 
whether various colored plastic mulches affect said plants’ growth, maturity and yield.  Red plastic 
mulch is thought to reflect a certain spectrum of sunlight having a special effect on tomato plants’ 
growth and maturity.  Results of these studies vary. It appears that various factors such as intensity of 
the sun, temperature, variety of plant, type and brand of plastic, and time of year when plastic was 
applied all may affect the result.

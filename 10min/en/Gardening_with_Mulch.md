## Gardening with Mulches  
Mulch is a layer of material spread over the soil surface to achieve one or more of the following benefits:  
- Reduce soil compaction from rain  
- Minimize soil erosion  
- Suppress weeds  
- Reduce spread of disease  
- Warm up the soil  
- Insulate the soil from extreme temperatures  
- Reduce evaporation  
- Keep the soil moist  

### Types of Mulch  
- **Organic mulches** are made from materials that once lived. Examples include sawdust, straw, yard debris, manure, and leaves.  
- **Plastic mulch** comes in various colors, including black, red, silver, and clear.

## Organic Mulches  
Organic mulches decompose over time, providing food for earthworms and other soil microbes.  

- **Fall Application**: Use green, non-composted material to prepare the garden for spring planting.  
- **Spring Application**: Use composted material to avoid nutrient competition with plants during decomposition.  

When using straw, autumn leaves, or other organic materials with low nitrogen content, add extra nitrogen fertilizer to aid decomposition.  
- **Straw**: Weed-free straw is lightweight but can be a fire hazard.  
- **Grass Clippings**: Apply a thin layer to prevent sliminess or crust formation that blocks water penetration.  

Spread a 2–4 inch layer of organic mulch around plants, avoiding coverage of the plants or their crowns. At the end of the gardening season, work organic mulches into the soil to improve its texture for the next planting season.  

### How to Use Organic Mulches  
1. **Fall**: Remove diseased leaves and weeds, then add a layer of organic mulch to suppress weeds and protect plant roots from freezing temperatures.  
2. **Spring**: Push mulch away from plants to help the soil in the root zone warm up faster.  
3. **Summer**: Before temperatures climb, push mulch back to cover the root zone to minimize evaporation and moderate soil temperature changes.  

Reapply organic mulch as it breaks down to maintain its benefits.

## Plastic Mulch  
Plastic mulch is often used to suppress weeds or warm the soil.  

- A 3–5 foot wide strip of plastic mulch placed over the root zone of tomato plants can speed up ripening by 10–14 days.  
- Plastic mulch reduces evaporation but breaks down under ultraviolet light, requiring replacement as needed.  

### How to Use Plastic Mulch  
#### To Suppress Weeds  
1. Lay black plastic after soil preparation for seeding or planting and after water lines have been placed.  
2. Weigh down the edges with soil.  
3. Insert seeds or transplants through an X cut in the plastic.  
4. Use perforated plastic or create perforations with an ice pick to allow water through.  

#### To Warm the Soil  
- **Clear or Translucent Plastic**: Warms the soil more effectively but may create a "greenhouse" for weeds.  
- **Black Plastic**: Warms the soil to a lesser degree but suppresses weeds.  

#### To Keep the Soil Dry  
Cover the area with black plastic during winter to keep the garden bed dry for early spring soil preparation and planting. Weigh down the edges to prevent it from becoming a greenhouse for weeds or a hiding place for pests.  

#### To Accelerate Growth and Maturity of Heat-Loving Plants  
Tomato, pepper, melon, strawberry, and other heat-loving plants have been studied to determine the effects of various colored plastic mulches on growth, maturity, and yield.  

- **Red Plastic Mulch**: Thought to reflect a specific spectrum of sunlight that may affect tomato plant growth and maturity.  
- Results vary depending on factors such as sunlight intensity, temperature, plant variety, type and brand of plastic, and timing of application.

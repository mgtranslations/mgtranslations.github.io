Firewise Landscaping to Reduce Wildfire Risk 
Introduction 
Firewise landscapes help to protect your home, property and save lives. Careful design and wise plant choices help 
to create a defensible space around your home. A wide array of attractive and fire-resistant landscape materials, 
trees, shrubs and flowering plants are available. Fire-resistant does not mean fireproof. This handout is intended as 
a guide, not a guarantee.  
 
Assess your Home and Yard for Wildfire Risk Factors 
There is much you can do to reduce risks! Two primary factors determine whether a home survives a wildfire: 1. The 
effectiveness of the defensible space surrounding it (i.e., firefighter access to the property)  
2. Its structural ignitability. These two elements define the Home Ignition Zone or HIZ.  
 
Immediate Zone, HIZ 1 - Includes the home out to 5 feet from 
the foundation. Objective: reduce the chance of ignition near 
the home. No vegetation other than annual baskets/containers 
and well-maintained lawn. 
Intermediate Zone, HIZ 2 – Includes 5-30 feet around your 
home. Objective: prevent the fire from climbing into upper por-
tions of trees or shrubs to keep the home safe. Eliminate ladder 
fuels - low tree branches and nearby shrubs that can boost 
flames to reach the home. This zone should be “lean, clean and 
green.” 
 
Extended Zone, HIZ 3 - Includes 30-100 (or more) feet around 
your home. Objective: reduce the energy of the wildfire and 
slow its advance to reach buildings. This zone becomes larger 
where steep slopes are present because slopes increase flame 
lengths of fires. Create a clean, discontinuous path of vegeta-
tion, making it difficult for the fire to burn directly to the build-
ing.

Structural Ignitability           
      Did you know that the majority of homes lost to wildfires are the result of embers from a wildfire and not the fire 
itself? Pay close attention to flammability of structures such as the home, fences, decks and outbuildings. Roofs are 
the most vulnerable in a fire due to flying embers. Embers can also enter through the ventilation system. Changing 
flammable building materials to more fire-retardant materials like metal, tile, pavers and rock can make a differ-
ence. Use fire-protection vents designed to be ember and fire safe.  Use of Class 1 roofing materials and keeping the 
roof and gutters clear of organic debris deter ignition. Keep firewood and combustible materials such as overhang-
ing trees and dense plants adjacent to buildings, vents, windows and decks away from home.   
        
 

 
 
       Firewise vs Traditional Landscaping 
Fire-Resistant Plants Characteristics Highly Flammable Plants Characteristics 
Important qualities: High moisture content, open branching habits 
and non-resinous vegetation. The high moisture acts as a heat sink, 
reducing the intensity and spread of fire. Generally, deciduous trees 
and plants are less flammable than conifers. 
Flammable plants have low moisture content and of-
ten substances such as oils, resins, wax or pitch. Ex-
amples include ornamental juniper, Leyland cypress, 
Italian cypress, rosemary, arborvitae, eucalyptus. 
Fire-Resistant Plant Options Highly Flammable Plants to Avoid 
HIZ 1 Plants that work include annuals & turf. Keep them well irri-
gated.  
HIZ 2 Includes low growing, open branching shrubs such as lilac and 
snowberry as well as smaller trees such as vine maple and crabapple.   
Annuals and perennials that do not contain volatile compounds may 
also be used. 
HIZ 3 Incorporates larger trees and scrubs with adequate spacing. 
Trees are trimmed up with large, open spaces between them. Decid-
uous trees in leaf, such as flowering dogwood and western catalpa, 
can be fire resistant. Ponderosa pine and western larch are the most 
fire resistant of the conifers. The OSU publication below has a wide 
array of plants, scrubs and trees for the firewise landscape. 
HIZ 1 Avoid shrubs, especially those containing vola-
tile compounds, such as juniper, arborvitae and rose-
mary. Also avoid trees that overhang the roof to pro-
duce roof litter prone to embers. Fire in branches and 
the crown of an overhanging tree provides ladder 
fuels.   
HIZ 2 & 3 Conifers tend to be more flammable than 
deciduous trees. Pay attention to patches of invasive 
plants such as blackberry and French broom. If left 
unmanaged, they can form patches of dry debris that 
add fuel to a fire. 
Positive Cultural Practices at Home   Fire Hazards Around the Home and Property 
HIZ 1 Maintain plants with appropriate watering and pruning.  Dis-
pose of dead plant debris. Keep the lawn mowed.  
HIZ 2 Keep plants healthy with watering and pruning. This zone can 
be mulched if irrigated. Rake and remove debris.  
HIZ 3 Keep a wide access path so First Responders can maneuver. 
Maintain mature trees/shrubs by trimming up lower branches and 
removing diseased or dying parts. Remove overgrown invasive 
plants. Prune dense vegetation and thin out clusters of trees.  
HIZ 1 Mulch is not advised, due to its combustible na-
ture. Wooden fences, gates and arbors can act as lad-
der fuels. Maintain 
wooden decks and don’t store combustible materials 
under or near decks.   
HIZ 2 Don’t place highly flammable plants adjacent to 
any structure. Keep grass mowed. Rake and remove 
vegetation debris. 
HIZ 3 Store firewood at least 30 feet from home. 
Fire-Resistant Landscaping Material Guidelines Highly Flammable Landscaping Materials 
Noncombustible materials: concrete, gravel, brick, rock, iron, alumi-
num, glass. Lawn and low-growing ground covers may slow flames 
and create fire breaks.  
Tests show that Western red cedar bark is the most 
easily ignited mulch. Fences, gates, and trellises made 
from wood are combustible.

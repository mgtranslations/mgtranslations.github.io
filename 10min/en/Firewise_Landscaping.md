## Firewise Landscaping to Reduce Wildfire Risk  

### Introduction  
Firewise landscapes help to protect your home, property, and save lives. Careful design and wise plant choices help create a defensible space around your home. A wide array of attractive and fire-resistant landscape materials, trees, shrubs, and flowering plants are available. Fire-resistant does not mean fireproof. This handout is intended as a guide, not a guarantee.

### Assess Your Home and Yard for Wildfire Risk Factors  
There is much you can do to reduce risks! Two primary factors determine whether a home survives a wildfire:  

1. **The effectiveness of the defensible space surrounding it** (i.e., firefighter access to the property).  
2. **Its structural ignitability.**  

These two elements define the **Home Ignition Zone (HIZ).**  

#### Immediate Zone (HIZ 1)  
- **Includes:** The home out to 5 feet from the foundation.  
- **Objective:** Reduce the chance of ignition near the home.  
- **Guidelines:**  
  - No vegetation other than annual baskets/containers and well-maintained lawn.  

#### Intermediate Zone (HIZ 2)  
- **Includes:** 5–30 feet around your home.  
- **Objective:** Prevent the fire from climbing into upper portions of trees or shrubs to keep the home safe.  
- **Guidelines:**  
  - Eliminate ladder fuels (low tree branches and nearby shrubs that can boost flames to reach the home).  
  - This zone should be “lean, clean, and green.”  

#### Extended Zone (HIZ 3)  
- **Includes:** 30–100 (or more) feet around your home.  
- **Objective:** Reduce the energy of the wildfire and slow its advance to reach buildings.  
- **Guidelines:**  
  - Create a clean, discontinuous path of vegetation, making it difficult for the fire to burn directly to the building.  
  - This zone becomes larger where steep slopes are present because slopes increase flame lengths of fires.

### Structural Ignitability  
Did you know that the majority of homes lost to wildfires are the result of embers from a wildfire and not the fire itself?  

#### Key Considerations:  
- **Roofs:**  
  - Roofs are the most vulnerable in a fire due to flying embers.  
  - Use Class 1 roofing materials and keep the roof and gutters clear of organic debris to deter ignition.  
- **Building Materials:**  
  - Replace flammable materials with fire-retardant options like metal, tile, pavers, and rock.  
  - Use fire-protection vents designed to be ember and fire safe.  
- **Combustible Materials:**  
  - Keep firewood, overhanging trees, and dense plants away from buildings, vents, windows, and decks.

### Firewise vs. Traditional Landscaping  

#### Fire-Resistant Plants Characteristics  
- High moisture content.  
- Open branching habits and non-resinous vegetation.  
- Deciduous trees and plants are generally less flammable than conifers.  

#### Highly Flammable Plants Characteristics  
- Low moisture content.  
- Contain substances such as oils, resins, wax, or pitch.  
- Examples: Ornamental juniper, Leyland cypress, Italian cypress, rosemary, arborvitae, eucalyptus.

### Fire-Resistant Plant Options  

#### HIZ 1  
- **Recommended:** Annuals and turf (keep them well irrigated).  
- **Avoid:** Shrubs containing volatile compounds (e.g., juniper, arborvitae, rosemary). Avoid trees that overhang the roof.  

#### HIZ 2  
- **Recommended:**  
  - Low-growing, open-branching shrubs (e.g., lilac, snowberry).  
  - Smaller trees (e.g., vine maple, crabapple).  
  - Annuals and perennials without volatile compounds.  
- **Avoid:** Highly flammable plants adjacent to structures.  

#### HIZ 3  
- **Recommended:**  
  - Larger trees and shrubs with adequate spacing.  
  - Deciduous trees in leaf (e.g., flowering dogwood, western catalpa).  
  - Fire-resistant conifers (e.g., ponderosa pine, western larch).  
- **Avoid:**  
  - Conifers near structures.  
  - Patches of invasive plants (e.g., blackberry, French broom).

### Positive Cultural Practices at Home  

#### HIZ 1  
- Maintain plants with appropriate watering and pruning.  
- Dispose of dead plant debris.  
- Keep the lawn mowed.  

#### HIZ 2  
- Keep plants healthy with watering and pruning.  
- Mulch if irrigated.  
- Rake and remove debris.  

#### HIZ 3  
- Maintain wide access paths for First Responders.  
- Trim lower branches of mature trees and shrubs.  
- Remove overgrown invasive plants.  
- Prune dense vegetation and thin out clusters of trees.

### Fire Hazards Around the Home and Property  

#### HIZ 1  
- Avoid mulch due to its combustible nature.  
- Wooden fences, gates, and arbors can act as ladder fuels.  
- Maintain wooden decks and avoid storing combustible materials under or near them.  

#### HIZ 2  
- Avoid highly flammable plants adjacent to structures.  
- Keep grass mowed and remove vegetation debris.  

#### HIZ 3  
- Store firewood at least 30 feet from the home.

### Fire-Resistant Landscaping Material Guidelines  

#### Recommended Materials  
- Noncombustible materials: Concrete, gravel, brick, rock, iron, aluminum, glass.  
- Lawn and low-growing ground covers may slow flames and create fire breaks.  

#### Highly Flammable Materials  
- Western red cedar bark is the most easily ignited mulch.  
- Fences, gates, and trellises made from wood are combustible.

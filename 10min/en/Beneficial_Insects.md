# Beneficial Insects in the Home Garden

### Overview

Among the more than 28,000 species of insects in the Pacific Northwest, only one to two percent damage crops, plants, or structures. The majority are beneficial and help the home gardener by controlling garden pests or pollinating fruits and vegetables. This handout explores common beneficial insects found in our region and shares ideas on ways to encourage their presence in our home gardens.

## Beneficial Insects

The three major types of beneficial insects are:

1. **Pollinators**  
   Pollinators include bees, flies, butterflies, and moths. In home gardens, honeybees, bumblebees, orchard mason bees, and syrphid flies are the most important pollinators. Many other minor pollinators, such as wasps, ants, midges, and beetles, also play a part. Pollinators play a critical role in the production of food crops and garden plants. Home gardeners can improve their garden’s health and productivity by encouraging pollinator presence.

2. **Predators**  
   Predators, such as lady beetles, praying mantis, lacewings, ground beetles, minute pirate bugs, damsel bugs, syrphid fly larvae, and snake flies, consume large numbers of other insects, keeping pest populations in check. By encouraging predators, home gardeners can reduce the need to control harmful insects.

3. **Parasitoids**  
   Parasitoids are insects that live on or in a host insect, feeding on the host and usually killing it over time. Common beneficial parasitoids include small stingless wasps and tachinid flies. Though not easily seen, research shows they have a significant impact on pest insect populations. Home gardeners can attract parasitoids by planting their favorite food plants, such as those bearing umbrella-shaped clusters (umbels) of minuscule flowers, including carrots, cilantro, dill, sweet clover, fennel, and Queen Anne’s lace.

## How to Encourage Beneficial Insects

### Create Habitats

You can provide habitat for a variety of beneficial insects in your home garden:

- **Ground Beetles and Rove Beetles**  
  These insects patrol the soil at night, feeding on slugs and cutworms. They need a place to hide during the day. Ground covers and coarse mulches such as bark dust, straw, and organic leaf mulch provide this habitat.

- **Native Bees**  
  Many native bees nest in the ground. A patch of bare soil or a dry bed of sparsely planted ornamental grass clumps is ideal. Covering soil with plastic mulch or frequent rototilling can destroy native bee nests. You can attract and keep native bees, such as Mason bees, by providing them with homemade or purchased nest boxes.

### Provide Food and Water

Insects need water to live. Offer water in a saucer filled with pebbles and keep it full on dry days.

- **Flowers for Pollinators**  
  Flowers provide nectar (sugar) and pollen (protein) for pollinators and their young. Variety is important, as different pollinators may have different food preferences. Recent research shows that areas with 15 or more species of flowering plants increase bee diversity. Gardeners should strive to provide a minimum of three species of blooming plants at any given time, spring through fall.

- **Butterflies and Moths**  
  Adult butterflies and moths usually prefer nectar, but their young feed on plant leaves. These “host plants” are where adults lay their eggs. Native ornamental trees and shrubs often serve as excellent host plants.

- **Predators and Parasitoids**  
  Many adult predators and parasitoids feed on nectar and pollen from insectary plants, such as yarrow, dill, marigold, and sunflower.

### Practice Integrated Pest Management

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a comprehensive and systematic approach to plant problems:

1. **Early Detection**  
   At the first sign of plant distress, collect evidence for proper diagnosis. Understanding the problem is essential for effective action. Many plant problems, when detected early, can be managed through non-chemical means.

2. **Consider Pesticides Carefully**  
   Before using systemic pesticides, particularly on plants visited by pollinators, weigh the benefits against the drawbacks. Systemic pesticides protect plant leaves from pests but can harm caterpillars, bees, and other beneficial insects when transported to nectar and pollen.

3. **Proper Application**  
   If pesticides must be used, follow label instructions carefully. Apply at the correct concentration, under suitable weather conditions, and to the appropriate part of the plant. Avoid treating blooming plants, nesting areas, and spray during cooler parts of the day (e.g., dusk or evening) when pollinators are less active.

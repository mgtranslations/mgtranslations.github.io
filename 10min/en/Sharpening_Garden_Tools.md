Sharpening Garden Tools 
 
Introduction 
Garden tools work best when they are sharp. Hand cutting tools such as pruners, loppers and 
hedge clippers are made of soft steel and can be sharpened with a file or hand stone.  Shovels are 
made of hard steel and require a file to sharpen.   
 
It is not necessary to take the tool apart each time you sharpen, however, it is a good idea to take 
apart, clean, sharpen and readjust each tool at the start, middle and end of your pruning season. 
Whether you disassemble the tool or simply sharpen it, clamp the tool securely. If the blade moves 
while being sharpened, severe injury can result. 
 
Tools  
• 6” smooth file* (for smaller blades, e.g. hand pruners), flat on one side, curved on the other 
• 8” to 10” mill file* (for larger blades, e.g. shovels, loppers), flat on one side, curved on the other 
• Diamond or ceramic hone (optional – for harder steel in high quality pruners) 
• File card (for cleaning files) 
• Light machine oil (e.g. 3-in-1 Oil) for lubricating joints and coating metal surfaces to protect 
from rust. 
• Shop rags (2 or more dry, 1 oily) 
• Wire brush and 400 to 600 grit sand paper (for removing rust)  
• Table vise to secure the tool 
*If your file has an exposed tang (a pointed end where you hold it during use) also purchase a 
handle for the file. NEVER use a file with an exposed tang – severe injury can result. Some files have 
a broad handle instead of a tang. Handles are unnecessary for these files. 
 
How to Sharpen 
1. Determine which surface needs sharpening.  
Tool Number of blade need sharpening Sides of blade need sharpening 
Hand pruner One One 
Lopper One One 
Grass shear One Both 
Shovel One One  
Hoe One One 
Picks, mattocks, axe One Both 
Hay fork Many Each tine sharpened to a dull point 
 
2. Clean tools  
Remove soil and pitch to clean the surface of the each tool, realign tines of forks, and check the 
file(s) for materials stuck between the teeth. If found, clean the file with the file card by wiping 
the file card across the file in line with the teeth. For a double-cut file, work the file card across 
the file in line with each angle. DO NOT use soap or water on a file. 
3. Use a vise to steady the tool  
 

Put your tool in the vise on the flattest portion of the blade base. If you tighten the vise in the 
wrong location, you can bend your pruning tool. 
4. Set sharpening angle  
A 20° to 25° sharpening angle is desired. How do you determine this? Hold your file across the 
blade perpendicular to it. That will make a 90-degree angle. Now turn the file downward 1/2 
the distance to the blade. That is 45 degrees. Now turn it 1/2 the remaining distance again. That 
puts you at about 22.5 degrees, which gets you to where you can begin sharpening.  
5. Begin to sharpen 
Each filing stroke must run parallel to the blade and run the full length of the blade. Apply even 
pressure from the tip to the base and only on the forward stroke.  As you file, the blade will 
become shiny. This is the bevel. If you are holding the file correctly, this shiny portion should be 
of even width along the whole blade. As the edge sharpens, burrs will develop on the backside 
of the blade. To remove these, hold the file flat against the blade and stroke the file toward the 
tip.  
On loppers out of adjustment, you will notice shiny metal on the base of the anvil blade 
indicating the cutting blade is slicing too tightly against or, even into, the anvil. Readjust blades 
immediately. 
6. Add finishing touches 
For hard metal blades, use a medium carborundum type sharpening stone as the final step in 
your sharpening process. If you have Felco, ARS or other hard steel blades, you may also finish 
sharpening them with a fine diamond or ultra-fine ceramic hone. This step takes only one or 
two passes. 
 
Cautions 
• Protect your eyes with safety glasses during sharpening. 
• If you have a Hickok Lopper, the manufacturer recommends using a medium or fine grade 
carborundum sharpening stone, diamond or ceramic stone. Any hollow ground blade should be 
sharpened with one of these tools and not a file. 
• The triangular ceramic stones are excellent for touching up the blades of better steel hand 
pruners like Felco and ARS when you cannot take the tool apart.

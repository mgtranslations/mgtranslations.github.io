## The Enabled Gardener  

### Introduction  
Gardening can provide a life-long hobby that has both mental and physical benefits. As we age or deal with injuries, the physical challenges require some adaptations to continue gardening. From gardeners with a touch of arthritis to gardening in a wheelchair, there is a wide array of solutions.

### Tool Selection  
Choosing the correct size and function for gardening tools can make all the difference in comfort and effective use of tools.  

#### Pruning Tools  
- **Pruners**  
  - Size matters! Find the size that fits your hand best for ease of use and comfort. Many pruners come in small, medium, and large versions. They also come in left- and right-handed versions.  
- **Loppers**  
  - Choose a length that works for your pruning position. Loppers with extendable, lightweight aluminum handles allow you to adjust the length as needed.  
- **Pruning Blades and Mechanisms**  
  - **Bypass Pruners**  
    - Work in a scissors motion with one blade passing over the other.  
    - **Advantages**: A good clean cut and versatile for both green and dead wood.  
  - **Anvil Pruners**  
    - Work with the top blade coming down on the bottom blade like a knife against a cutting board.  
    - **Advantages/Disadvantages**: The blade opening does not need to be as wide as with bypass pruners; very good for dead or dry wood but can crush green stems; cut is not as clean.  
  - **Ratchet Pruning Shears and Ratchet Loppers**  
    - Use a compound mechanism action which requires less strength and allows you to cut gradually through a branch or stem.  
  - **Geared Loppers**  
    - Provide 40% more power when cutting. Longer handles give more leverage.  

#### Hand Tools  
- Look for ergonomic tools that keep the wrist in a neutral position with the wrist in a straight line with the forearm. As mobility and strength diminish, it is more efficient to use larger joints to get the job done. Being able to use the forearm and shoulder for a task takes strain off hands and wrists.  
- Adaptations such as “D” handles can be added to standard rakes and brooms for good grip and to help keep wrists straight.  
- Use padding to make handles larger and give a softer grip. Foam sheets attached with duct tape and bicycle handlebar wraps are two solutions that work well. There are many ways to adapt garden tools to help with back, knee, hip, hand, and arm problems.

- A drill fitted with an auger bit is useful for creating planting holes. A corded drill weighs less than a battery-powered one, and the addition of a side-handle on the drill gives more control.  
- Rakes, both leaf and bowhead, come with lightweight, adjustable handles. Some leaf rakes have collapsible heads that can work as lawn rakes or reach into smaller spaces.

### Garden Design  

- **Paving**  
  - A hard, even surface with good traction is the best possible solution. Poured concrete and tight, smooth pavers are optimal. Wood decks and packed, decomposed granite paths also work. Avoid loose materials, such as uncompacted gravel and wood chips that can become uneven over time.  
- **Pathway**  
  - Pathways that are at least 36” wide provide enough room to maneuver a wheelchair or walker, but 48” is optimal. Keep pathways clear of obstacles.  
- **Handrails**  
  - Consider adding handrails along pathways. Place them along stairs or steps before grade changes.  
- **Improved Access**  
  - Raised beds are the gold standard for garden access for people with mobility issues. These can be as simple as a stock tank or grow bag or constructed out of wood or masonry. A wide enough top surface that also works as a bench from which to work or rest is a good feature.

- **Go Vertical**  
  - Trellises and vertical growing systems provide easier access to many vegetables and ornamental vines.  
- **Watering**  
  - Use lightweight hoses, soaker hoses, or drip systems to make watering easier. Keep hoses as short as possible. Raised beds and pots or bags can require watering more frequently than plants in the ground. Pots can be adapted to be self-watering.  
- **Seating**  
  - Provide lightweight seating in garden areas that can be moved to shade or sun as required.

### Plant Selection  
- Choose lower maintenance, smaller versions of your favorite ornamentals and vegetables.

### Mobility Aids  
- Dual-purpose garden kneeler/seats with storage pockets on the handles  
- Wheeled garden seats with attached storage that moves with you as you work  
- Multi-wheel wheelbarrows for stability and versatility  
- Garden carts for all your tools and supplies that move with you and save unnecessary steps  

---

### Physical Conditioning  
- Stretching before and after gardening can alleviate pain and stiffness. Check with your doctor/physical therapist/personal trainer for appropriate flexibility and strength training before starting exercises.  
- Building muscle flexibility and strength can make gardening easier and more enjoyable. Many gyms have trainers or classes that can give you exercises suited to your abilities.

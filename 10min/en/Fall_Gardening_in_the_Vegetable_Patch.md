## Fall Gardening in the Vegetable Patch

### Harvesting and Storing Vegetables

- **Green Tomatoes**: Harvest green tomatoes with whitish color on the bottom to ripen indoors. Collect seeds from ripe tomatoes all season. Scoop seeds into a jar with water, ferment for 3–5 days, rinse flesh off seeds in a strainer, dry on a paper towel, and place in a labeled envelope for storing.
- **Potatoes**: Harvest 2 weeks after vines die or are cut to toughen skins, but before fall rains. Dig, dry, and don’t wash. Store in a cool (40+ degrees), dark, ventilated location, not in plastic.
- **Winter Squash**: Harvest at maturity (when thumbnail will not pierce the skin) and before frost (below 28 degrees) as damage may occur. Store in a dry, dark, cool location, about 50 degrees.
- **Dry Beans**: Leave seeds on the vine until they rattle, or cut damp golden pods to dry inside with no heat or sun.
- **Root Vegetables**: Leave carrots, beets, turnips, onions, and leeks in the ground and protect with 1–2 inches of dry leaves or straw, or use row covers. Swiss chard, kale, and collards generally survive the winter without protection during a mild winter.
- **Herbs**: Prune thyme and rosemary and dry the leaves. Hard prune rosemary only if harvesting for skewers.
- **Basil**: Harvest before night temperatures drop below 50 degrees. Process immediately or put stems in water to hold. Make pesto, or cut, pack into ice cube trays, cover with water, and freeze.

### Planting Fall and Winter Vegetables

- **Why Plant in Fall?**
  - Soil is dry and warm.
  - Some crops grow best in cool weather.
  - Fewer pests.
  - Less need for watering.
  - Fresh produce during winter and spring.

- **Fall and Winter Harvests**:
  - Start beet, broccoli, cabbage, carrot, Chinese cabbage, collard, kale, kohlrabi, rutabaga, and Swiss chard from seeds in July. Seedlings planted in late summer/early fall need at least 4 weeks of growth to tolerate winter temperatures.
  - Directly seed fava beans (October–November), arugula, some onions, and mustard (to mid-October).
  - Plant garlic cloves (point up) 2–3 inches deep in October/early November.

### Using Season Extenders

Season extenders help small plants grow better and protect them from winter cold and severe weather. They include:

- **Row Covers, Cold Frames, and Cloches**: Warm the air and protect plants. Facing south is best.
- **Plastic Mulch**: Warms the soil.
- **Hot Beds**: Cold frames with a heating cable buried 2+ inches below the soil surface warm both soil and air.

## Vegetable Patch Clean-Up

Fall cleaning makes spring gardening easier:

- Remove and dispose of weeds and rotten or immature fruit.
- Pull, cut, or prune diseased plants and foliage for commercial composting.
- Place dead foliage and stems in the home compost.
- Bait slugs and snails to reduce fall and spring populations.

## Soil Improvement

- Add 2–4 inches of leaves or compost as mulch to reduce compaction and erosion, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
- **Cover Crops**: Plant by October 1 to reduce compaction and soil erosion and add nutrients when turned into the soil in spring.
- **Soil pH Testing**:
  - Collect a soil sample by removing top vegetation or mulch (use clean tools, gloves, and hands).
  - Dig down 6–8 inches and remove a vertical slice of soil. Repeat the process in several places in the garden.
  - Mix samples in a container, transfer ½ cup to a plastic bag for testing.
  - If lime is needed, applications in fall will prepare the soil for spring planting. Do not lime potato planting areas, as lime leads to scabby potatoes.

- Use commercial laboratories for soil nutrient analysis. Clackamas County Master Gardeners test soil samples for pH at three annual events. Check [www.cmastergardeners.org](http://www.cmastergardeners.org) for specifics.

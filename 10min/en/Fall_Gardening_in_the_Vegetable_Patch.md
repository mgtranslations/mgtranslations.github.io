Fall Gardening in the Vegetable Patch 
Harvesting and Storing Vegetables   
• Harvest green tomatoes with whitish color on bottom to ripen indoors. Collect seeds from ripe 
tomatoes all season. Scoop seeds into jar with water, ferment 3-5 days, rinse flesh off seeds in 
strainer, dry on paper towel, and place in labeled envelop for storing. 
• Harvest potatoes 2 weeks after vines die or are cut to toughen skins, but before fall rains. Dig, dry, 
and don’t wash. Store in a cool (40+ degrees), dark, ventilated location, not in plastic.   
• Harvest winter squash at maturity (when thumb nail will not pierce the skin) and before frost 
(below 28 degrees) as damage may occur. Store in dry, dark, cool location, about 50 degrees.   
• Dry bean seeds on the vine until they rattle, or cut damp golden pods to dry inside with no heat 
or sun.   
• Leave root vegetables (carrots, beets, turnips, onions & lees) in the ground and protect with over 
with 1 to 2 inches of dry leaves or straw, or protect with row cover.  Swiss chard, kale and collard 
generally survive the winter without protection during a mild winter. 
• Prune thyme and rosemary and dry the leaves.  Hard prune rosemary only if harvesting for 
skewers.   
• Harvest basil before night temperature drops below 50 degrees.  Process immediately or put 
stems in water to hold. Make pesto, or cut, pack into ice cube trays, cover with water, and freeze. 
 
Planting Fall and Winter Vegetables 
• The reasons to plant in the fall are: the soil is dry and warm; some crops grow best in cool 
weather; there are fewer pests; there is less need for watering; and you can have fresh produce 
during the winter and spring.   
• For fall and winter harvests, start beet, broccoli, cabbage, carrot, Chinese cabbage, collard, kale, 
kohlrabi, rutabaga, and Swiss chard from seeds in July. Seedlings planted in late summer/early fall 
need at least 4 weeks growth to tolerate winter temperature.   
• Plants that can be directly seeded in the fall include: fava beans (Oct.–Nov,), arugula, some 
onions, and mustard (to mid-Oct.); and garlic cloves, point up and 2 to 3 inches deep 
(October/early November).   
 
Using Season Extenders  
Season extenders help small plants grow better and protect the plants from winter cold and severe 
weather. They include: 
• Row covers, cold frames (facing south is best), and cloches that warm the air and protect plants;  
• Plastic mulch that warms the soil; and 
• Hot beds, cold frames with a heating cable buried 2+ inches below the soil surface, warm both soil 
and air.   
 
 
 

Vegetable Patch Clean-up  
Fall cleaning makes spring gardening easier. Remove and dispose of weeds and rotten and immature 
fruit. Pull, cut or prune diseased plants and foliage for commercial composting. Place dead foliage and 
stems in the home compost. Bait slugs and snails to reduce fall and spring populations. 
 
Soil Improvement  
Add 2 to 4 inches of leaves or compost as mulch to reduce compaction and erosion, suppress weeds, 
and regulate soil temperature. October 1 is the target date for planting cover crops which reduce 
compaction and soil erosion and add nutrients when turned into the soil in the spring.  
 
Fall is the ideal time to test soil pH. Collect a soil sample by removing top vegetation or mulch (use 
clean tools, gloves, and hands), dig down 6 to 8 inches and remove a vertical slice of soil. Repeat the 
process in several places of the garden. Mix samples in a container, transfer ½ cup to a plastic bag for 
testing.  If lime is needed, applications in fall will have the soil ready for planting in the spring.  Don’t 
lime potato planting areas, as lime leads to scabby potatoes.   
 
Use commercial laboratories for soil nutrient analysis. Clackamas County Master Gardeners test soil 
samples for pH at three annual events. Check www.cmastergardeners.org for specifics.

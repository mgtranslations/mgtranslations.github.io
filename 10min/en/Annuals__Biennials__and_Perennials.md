Annuals, Biennials, & Perennials 
Overview   
 Gardeners have numerous choices – sometimes 
far too many – for their ornamental flower gardens, in 
part defined by the plants’ lifestyles.   
 Annual plants live for just a season.  Even so, we 
require they produce abundant showy blossoms for an 
extended while before they die. 
 Biennials live for two years. The first year they 
produce only a short stem and leaves, then will bloom 
the second year.  
 Perennial plants, though, live three or more years, 
typically with the first flowering cycle during the second 
year.  Short-lived kinds do well for just a few years 
whereas long-lived types may last for decades.   
Selecting your plants  
 When purchasing your annuals, biennials and 
perennials, select vigorous specimens having   
completely hydrated leaves and a healthy green color.  
Root tips should be a creamy-white color; check their 
condition by sliding the root ball out of the pot, then, of 
course, carefully replace the root ball. 
 Avoid plants with broken stems; dry, wilting, or 
yellow leaves; or damage from insects or disease.  The 
plant should fill out the container but the roots shouldn’t 
hang out the drainage holes.  Dangling roots are likely 
late in the season, after plants have been held too long 
in the same size pot.  
 As tempting as it is to buy annuals in full bloom, a 
far better choice is compact, well-branched, and well-
budded plants.  Flowering will be delayed for a while 
but with the bonus that the plant will live longer and 
ultimately flower more profusely. 
 In the garden center, look for biennials in the 
annual or perennial section.  Among the popular 
biennials are foxglove, also various campanulas such 
as Canterbury bell and chimney flower. 
 Perennials, whether evergreen or deciduous, are 
classified as hardy (survive frost), or tender (damaged 
by frost).   In our region, perennials will be hardy if they 
are labeled for USDA zone 7 or 8, or Sunset zone 6.  
Zones for local gardens can vary due to elevation. 
 Tender perennials can add variety and beauty to 
your garden when you grow them as you would 
annuals.  To grow them again next season, put them in 
a sheltered place for the winter. 
 Many flower bulbs are reliable perennials in our 
region, with daffodils and crocus perhaps the most 
common.  But lilies and dahlias do well, too; plant the 
lilies 4 to 6 inches deep, the dahlias at 7 to 8 inches 
deep.  Tulips aren’t likely to return the second year 
unless they are in an area which remains dry during 
the summer.  Among tulips, the various relatively small 
species are generally more reliable than are the larger-
flowered hybrids.   
Choosing the planting site 
 The printed label that comes with your purchased 
transplants typically indicates the best conditions of 
sun or shade, also moist or dry soil. 
 Most annuals, biennials and perennials do very 
well with morning sun and with protection from the hot 
afternoon sun; four hours of bright light is a minimum, 
six is better.  Others do well with some shade.   
 All plants thrive in soil that drains well.   
Planting  
 Certain annuals, biennials and perennials can be 
seeded directly into the garden while others are best 
started indoors.  The seed packet will state the best 
planting time, also spacing in the garden.   
 Or you can purchase young transplants for 
immediate gratification.  
 For the most part, all annuals, biennials and 
perennials do best if planted in the garden at the same 
depth as they were in the original pot. 
 The majority of plants do best in well-drained soil.  
To prepare the garden bed, begin by removing rocks 
and weeds from the area, then amend your soil by 
mixing in at least two inches of compost to improve 
drainage in clayey soils and increase water retention in 
sandy soils.  Amend again during each successive 
planting season. 
 Another tip for success is to make certain your 
plants and their root systems are thoroughly moist 
before you set them into moist garden soil.   
 To give your plants a running start, mix fertilizer 
into the soil as you put each plant in place.  You can 
use a slow release fertilizer or a combination of an all-
purpose fertilizer and bone meal.  Follow label 
directions as to the amount. 
 Finally, use fertilizer-enriched water diluted to half-
strength to settle the soil around the plants’ roots.   
Watering 
 Most annuals have fairly shallow roots, thus may 
need to be watered rather frequently. Wilting, even if 
minor, permanently stunts plants; your annuals will stall 
and blooms will be fewer than normal.  
 Biennials and perennials require regularly 
scheduled watering during the first season in order to 
 

establish sturdy root systems.  Each time you water, 
moisten the entire root zone which, on average, is 
about 12 to 15 inches deep. 
 Water early in the day so that the leaves dry before 
nightfall.  Better yet, water at the plant’s base.  
Fertilizing  
 Annuals, because we expect them to be very 
productive during their brief life, benefit from regular 
doses of water-soluble, all-purpose fertilizer once or 
twice a month.  You can apply additional doses if the 
plants lag.   
 Biennials and perennials will thrive with little or no 
supplemental fertilizer.  This is an instance where our 
clayey soils come in handy, they provide a slow but 
steady flow of required fertilizer elements.  Perennials 
tend to develop rather slowly into sturdy plants; but if 
they’re fertilized, they may flop and may even bloom 
less than you expect. 
 Don’t fertilize biennials and perennials in the fall 
because the plants need to shut down for winter.  You 
don't want to encourage any new growth late in the 
year which might be damaged by cold. 
Summer maintenance  
 Some annuals, among them impatiens and fibrous 
begonias, are self-cleaning in that you don't need to 
remove their spent flowers.  But most annuals need to 
be deadheaded; that is, have their spent flowers 
removed.   
 If you don’t deadhead, the plants start producing 
seed and are likely to stop blooming.  You can groom 
the plants at the same time by removing dying or dead 
leaves or branches. 
 It‘s also important to deadhead perennials so that 
they won’t set seed, but will continue to bloom as long 
as possible. 
Fall maintenance  
 As you probably know, annuals are removed, then 
discarded or composted, at the end of the season. 
 On the other hand, first-season biennials will be a 
rosette of nicely green leaves which will persist through 
the winter.  The only tidying you need do is to remove 
any yellowed leaves which may be present.  When 
growth resumes in spring, the flower stem will extend 
upward to produce the expected floral display.   
 You can cut most herbaceous perennials to the 
ground when they start to look ratty in late fall.  Even 
so, some will have attractive seed heads you may want 
to retain during the winter for the birds, or simply 
because they add interesting details to the scene.  
Others, among them various ornamental grasses, can 
provide winter interest with their tawny-colored blades. 
 Some perennials don't reappear aboveground until 
relatively late in spring.  With these, you may want to 
retain part of the stalk to mark the location so you won't 
disturb the root system while weeding or planting. 
 Evergreen perennials are generally cut back in  
spring, just before new growth begins.  Delaying until 
spring is particularly important with such warmth-
requiring perennials as lavender, rosemary and sage. 
 With time, clumping perennials get crowded, flower 
less, and begin to decline.  To refresh them, dig and 
divide the clump just before new growth begins, then 
replant in newly amended soil.  A few, such as peonies 
and hosta, will thrive in the same place for many years.

## Annuals, Biennials, & Perennials  

### Overview  
Gardeners have numerous choices—sometimes far too many—for their ornamental flower gardens, in part defined by the plants’ lifestyles.  

- **Annual plants** live for just a season. Even so, we require they produce abundant showy blossoms for an extended while before they die.  
- **Biennials** live for two years. The first year they produce only a short stem and leaves, then bloom the second year.  
- **Perennial plants** live three or more years, typically with the first flowering cycle during the second year. Short-lived kinds do well for just a few years, whereas long-lived types may last for decades.

## Selecting Your Plants  
When purchasing your annuals, biennials, and perennials, select vigorous specimens with:  
- Completely hydrated leaves and a healthy green color.  
- Root tips that are creamy-white in color. Check their condition by sliding the root ball out of the pot, then carefully replace it.  

### Avoid plants with:  
- Broken stems.  
- Dry, wilting, or yellow leaves.  
- Damage from insects or disease.  
- Roots hanging out of the drainage holes (often a sign the plant has been held too long in the same pot).  

### Tips for Selection:  
- **Annuals:** Choose compact, well-branched, and well-budded plants rather than those in full bloom. This delays flowering but ensures the plant will live longer and flower more profusely.  
- **Biennials:** Look for them in the annual or perennial section. Popular options include foxglove and various campanulas like Canterbury bell and chimney flower.  
- **Perennials:**  
  - Classified as hardy (survive frost) or tender (damaged by frost).  
  - In our region, hardy perennials are labeled for USDA zone 7 or 8, or Sunset zone 6.  
  - Tender perennials can be grown as annuals or overwintered in a sheltered place.  

### Bulbs:  
- Reliable perennials include daffodils, crocus, lilies, and dahlias.  
- Tulips may not return unless planted in areas that remain dry during summer. Species tulips are generally more reliable than larger-flowered hybrids.

## Choosing the Planting Site  
The printed label on your purchased transplants typically indicates the best conditions for:  
- **Sun or shade.**  
- **Moist or dry soil.**  

Most annuals, biennials, and perennials thrive with:  
- Morning sun and protection from hot afternoon sun (minimum of 4 hours of bright light, 6 is better).  
- Well-drained soil.

## Planting  

### From Seed:  
- Some annuals, biennials, and perennials can be seeded directly into the garden, while others are best started indoors.  
- Refer to the seed packet for planting time and spacing.  

### From Transplants:  
- Plant at the same depth as in the original pot.  
- Prepare the garden bed by:  
  - Removing rocks and weeds.  
  - Amending the soil with at least 2 inches of compost to improve drainage in clay soils and increase water retention in sandy soils.  
  - Amending again during each successive planting season.  

### Additional Tips:  
- Ensure plants and their root systems are thoroughly moist before planting in moist garden soil.  
- Mix fertilizer into the soil when planting. Use a slow-release fertilizer or a combination of all-purpose fertilizer and bone meal (follow label directions).  
- Use fertilizer-enriched water diluted to half-strength to settle the soil around the plants’ roots.

## Watering  
- **Annuals:**  
  - Have shallow roots and may need frequent watering.  
  - Avoid wilting, as it permanently stunts plants and reduces blooms.  
- **Biennials and Perennials:**  
  - Require regular watering during the first season to establish sturdy root systems.  
  - Water deeply to moisten the root zone (12–15 inches deep).  
  - Water early in the day to allow leaves to dry before nightfall. Water at the plant’s base for best results.

## Fertilizing  

### Annuals:  
- Benefit from regular doses of water-soluble, all-purpose fertilizer once or twice a month.  
- Apply additional doses if plants lag.  

### Biennials and Perennials:  
- Thrive with little or no supplemental fertilizer.  
- Avoid fertilizing in the fall to prevent new growth that could be damaged by cold.  

---

## Summer Maintenance  
- Some annuals (e.g., impatiens and fibrous begonias) are self-cleaning and don’t require deadheading.  
- Most annuals and perennials need deadheading to prevent seed production and encourage continued blooming.  
- Groom plants by removing dying or dead leaves and branches.  

---

## Fall Maintenance  
- **Annuals:** Remove and discard or compost at the end of the season.  
- **Biennials:** First-season plants will form a rosette of green leaves that persist through winter. Remove yellowed leaves as needed.  
- **Perennials:**  
  - Cut most herbaceous perennials to the ground in late fall unless they have attractive seed heads or ornamental grasses for winter interest.  
  - Some perennials reappear late in spring; retain part of the stalk to mark their location.  
  - Evergreen perennials are generally cut back in spring, just before new growth begins.  

### Dividing Perennials:  
- Clumping perennials may need dividing when they become crowded, flower less, or begin to decline.  
- Divide and replant in newly amended soil just before new growth begins.  
- Some, like peonies and hostas, thrive in the same place for many years.

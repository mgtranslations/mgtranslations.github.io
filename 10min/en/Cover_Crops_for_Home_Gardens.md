Cover Crops for Home Vegetable Gardens 
Cover crops cover and improve the soil. They may be planted in the fall to cover fallow areas or planted 
in the spring as part of crop rotation. Many plants, including legumes, grasses, and broadleaf perennials 
serve this purpose.  
Benefits  
• Add organic matter to soil and improve soil tilth 
• Legumes supply nitrogen  
• Protect soil from compaction  
• Suppress weeds 
• Recycle nutrients and prevent leaching  
• Protect soil from erosion 
• Provide food (pollen and nectar) for pollinators and other beneficial insects 
 
How to Choose  
There are many candidates for cover crops, each has its merits and drawbacks. In general, they produce 
biomass during a time when the garden is fallow. This biomass, after termination, becomes a source of 
organic matter to improve water and nutrient-holding capacity of the soil. Cover crops increase soil 
organic matter whether they are cut and used as a mulch or are incorporated into the soil. 
 
Legumes fix nitrogen in the air and store them in root nodules. When the plant is terminated (killed), soil 
microbes break it down and release the nitrogen for plant use. Legume cover crops reduce the need for 
nitrogen fertilizer. 
Grasses establish fast to prevent soil erosion and suppress weeds. Their deep roots condition soil and 
capture remaining nitrogen in the soil at the end of a growing season to prevent nutrient leaching. When 
grasses are used alone, there is a potential of depleting nitrogen from the soil. Use grass and legume 
together to reap the greatest benefits from cover crops. 
Other forbs (herbaceous plants other than grass) like buckwheat and phacelia have higher nitrogen 
content than grasses, but less then legumes. They can supply some nitrogen to the next crop and usually 
don’t deplete soil nitrogen. They are also easy to incorporate. They flower prolifically and can provide 
food for pollinators and other beneficial insects. 
 
How to Start 
       Selection 
If you are new to cover crops, choose options, such as oats and daikon, that will likely be killed in the 
winter. These plants do not require extra steps for termination before planting the next crop. Otherwise, 
select cover crop based on desired benefits. Some common species are listed below:

Timing 
To cover the soil during the fall and winter, plant cover crop in late summer into fall. Water before rain 
comes for good germination and strong growth. For covering the soil during spring and summer, plant in 
late spring when the soil becomes workable and is warm enough for germination. 
 
Sowing 
Sow seeds directly into a prepared area. Follow the instruction that comes with seeds for application 
rate. Broadcast by hand or a hand-held seed broadcaster. Rake the surface and gently press with a piece 
of wood to improve contact with the soil. Water well for good germination.  
 
If planting in an area where summer crop is done, plant over an entire bed. Remove mulch, clear 
vegetation, loosen the top 1-2 inches of soil, then sow seeds. If the summer crop is not done, remove 
mulch, loosen the top layer of soil, and sow cover crop seeds between summer vegetables. 
 
Termination 
Terminate cover crops during early flowering to return the maximum benefit of biomass and nutrients. If 
termination takes place after seed formation, the cover crops become a weed for the next crop.  
 
Termination involves mowing or bending the stems to kill the top and laying them on top of the soil (no-
till approach) or incorporating into the soil. Cover the area with a tarp can speed the process. Plant 
materials incorporated into the soil should be chopped for faster decomposition. Allow 3-4 weeks 
before planting the next crop.

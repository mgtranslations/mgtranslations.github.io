## Greenhouse Gardening 101  

### Introduction  
The addition of a greenhouse to a home garden can provide an early start on the growing season and extend the season in the fall. It can also provide protection for temperature-sensitive plants. On the human side, it can be delightful to garden in the dead of winter while protected from the elements. A greenhouse can range from a simple unit in a window opening to a complex structure with high insulation values, automated heating systems, plumbing, fans, and ventilation equipment.

### Determine Your Greenhouse Gardening Goals  

- **Cool House**  
  Perfect for gardeners who live in a mild climate and want to overwinter plants and start seeds in the spring. This type of greenhouse keeps the temperature at 40°F and above.  

- **Warm House**  
  Ideal for gardeners who live in a cold climate and want to grow orchids and citrus trees. Nighttime temperatures around 55°F work well.  

- **Hot House**  
  Designed for gardeners who want to grow tropical plants and require nighttime temperatures of no less than 60°F.

### Determine the Location  
- The more sun, the better—especially in the winter. Greenhouses are best oriented with the long side facing south or east.  
- Greenhouses facing west risk overheating, while those facing north are best suited for plants with low light requirements.  
- Placement near deciduous trees can allow sunlight in during colder months while providing shade during hot summers.  
- A level site with good drainage is optimal. A semi-pit or pit greenhouse, built into a slope with one or more sides below grade, can provide additional insulation.  

**Note:** Check with Homeowners Associations and local governmental agencies for restrictions on greenhouse placement. Permits may be required.

### Types of Greenhouses  

#### Attached Greenhouses  
- **Pros:**  
  - Can be less expensive.  
  - Provide more protection from the elements with one side sheltered by a structure.  
  - Electricity and water are usually nearby.  
  - Proximity to the house is convenient in inclement weather.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Height may be restricted by the building structure.  
  - A good vapor barrier is needed to prevent greenhouse humidity from seeping into the house insulation.  

#### Free-standing Greenhouses  
- **Pros:**  
  - Offer more flexibility in placement and provide more light.  
  - Wide variety of design options.  
  - Easier to expand by adding to the ends.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Water and electricity must be brought to the greenhouse.  
  - Higher heating costs due to larger wall area and exposure to the elements.

### Foundations  
Foundations are required for many greenhouses and can be constructed of treated wood, masonry, or concrete. It is important to construct the foundation according to the specifications of the greenhouse you plan to install.

### Framing Materials  

- **Galvanized Steel**  
  - Common for hoop or gothic-style greenhouses.  
  - Requires a galvanizing solution to prevent rust.  

- **Aluminum**  
  - Popular for many greenhouse kits.  
  - Durable, lightweight, and available in several colors.  

- **Wood**  
  - Provides the most insulation.  
  - Pressure-treated wood lasts longest and is best for ground contact.  
  - Decay-resistant options include redwood, cedar, and white oak heartwood.  
  - Painting or staining the frame before assembly extends its life.

### Glazing Materials  

- **Glass**  
  - Traditional greenhouse glazing.  
  - Offers the most light transmission and allows views into the garden.  
  - Single-pane glass transmits 85%–95% of light.  
  - Double-pane glass may break with temperature fluctuations. Factory-sealed, double-pane panels transmit 70%–75% of light.  

- **Polycarbonate**  
  - Lighter than glass and requires less structural framing.  
  - Twin-wall polycarbonate is excellent for greenhouse roofs due to light diffusion and resistance to breaking. Light transmission is 83%.  

- **Plastic**  
  - Commonly used for hoop houses.  
  - Clear 6 mil plastic transmits 87% of light.  
  - White 6 mil plastic transmits 40% of light.

### Utilities  

- **Electricity**  
  - Provides flexibility for grow lights, heat pads, fans, and heaters.  

- **Water**  
  - Easy access to a hose saves time and labor.  

- **Gas**  
  - Another option for heating. Proper ducting and ventilation are required.

### Accessories  

- **Heaters**  
  - Even a Cool Greenhouse may need heat to keep temperatures above freezing.  
  - Supplementary heat can range from a space heater to solar mass.  
  - Warmer temperatures may require a 220 V circuit.  

- **Thermometers**  
  - A minimum/maximum thermometer monitors high and low temperatures.  
  - Bluetooth thermometers can alert you immediately when temperatures are too low or too high.  

- **Air Circulation and Temperature Control**  
  - Good airflow is essential for healthy plants.  
  - Place vents on the roof and lower in the greenhouse to allow air movement and escape on hot days.  
  - A fan improves heating in winter and cooling in summer.  

- **Seed Starting Mats**  
  - Warm the growing medium to speed up germination.  

- **Lighting**  
  - Comes in various installation and bulb options.  
  - Lights hued toward the blue spectrum promote foliage growth, while those toward the red spectrum promote blooming.  
  - When starting seeds, place light fixtures approximately 4 inches from the growing medium surface, raising them as seedlings grow.

Greenhouse Gardening 101 
 
Introduction 
The addition of a greenhouse to a home garden can provide an early start on the growing season and extend the 
season in the fall. It can also provide protection for temperature sensitive plants. And, on the human side, it can 
be delightful to be gardening in the dead of winter while protected from the elements. A greenhouse can be as 
simple as a unit in a window opening or as complex as a structure complete with high insulation values, 
automated heating systems, plumbing, fans, and ventilation equipment. 
 
Determine Your Greenhouse Gardening Goals 
Cool House – Perfect for gardeners who live in a mild climate and want to overwinter plants and start seeds in 
the spring. This type of greenhouse keeps the greenhouse at 40 degrees and above. 
Warm House – For gardeners who live in a cold climate and want to grow orchids and citrus trees. Nighttime 
temperatures around 55 degrees work well.   
Hot House – Designed for gardeners who want to grow tropical plants and require nighttime temperatures of no 
less than 60 degrees. 
 
Determine the Location  
The more sun the better, especially in the winter. Greenhouses are best oriented with the long side facing south 
or east. Greenhouses facing west run the danger of getting too hot, while greenhouses facing north are best 
suited for plants with low light requirements. Placement near deciduous trees can allow sunlight in during the 
colder months of the year but provide welcome shade during hot summers. A site that is level and has good 
drainage is optimal. A semi-pit or pit greenhouse, with one or more sides below grade, can be built into a slope, 
providing more insulation.  
 
Depending on locale, Homeowners Associations and local governmental agencies may have restrictions on 
greenhouse placement. Check with the authorities early in the process to see if permits are required. 
 
Types of Greenhouses 
Attached Greenhouses are attached on the long side of the greenhouse or at the 
gable end to a wall of the house or garage. Pros – Can be less expensive and provide 
more protections from the elements with one side sheltered by a structure. Electricity 
and water are usually close by. Proximity to the house  can be a benefit in inclement 
weather. Cons – The height may be restricted by the building structure. A good vapor 
barrier is needed to keep the humidity from the greenhouse from seeping into the 
house insulation.   
 
Free-standing Greenhouses stand apart from other structures. Pros – They have 
more flexibility in placement and provide more light. There are a wide variety of 
design options, and it is easier to expand the structure by adding on to the ends.   
Cons – You must bring water and electricity to the greenhouse. Heating costs are 
higher due to the larger wall area and exposure to the elements.  
 

 
 
Foundations – 
Foundations are required on many greenhouses, and can be constructed of treated wood, masonry or concrete. 
It is important to construct the foundation to the specifications of the greenhouse you plan to install. 
 
Framing Materials  
Galvanized Steel – Most common for hoop or gothic style greenhouses. A galvanizing solution is required to keep 
the steel from rusting.  
Aluminum – A popular option for many greenhouse kits, it is durable, lightweight, and comes in several colors. 
Wood – Providing the most insulation factor, wood is popular for people who want to build their own 
greenhouse. Pressure treated wood will last longest, and is best for wood with ground contact. Redwood, cedar, 
and white oak heartwood can be very decay resistant as well. Painting or staining the frame before assembly also 
extends the life. 
 
Glazing Materials  
Glass is the traditional greenhouse glazing. It offers the most light transmission and makes it pleasant to see out 
into the garden. Single pane glass has a light transmittance of 85% - 95%. Double paned glass may break with 
fluctuations in temperature. Factory sealed, double paned panels, transmit 70% - 75% of light. 
Polycarbonate – Lighter in weight than glass, it requires less structural framing. Twin wall polycarbonate is an 
excellent choice for greenhouse roofs due to light diffusion and resistance to breaking. Light transmission is 83%. 
Plastic is used for hoop houses. Clear 6 mil transmits 87% of light. White 6 mil transmits 40%. 
 
Utilities – 
Electricity – Electricity in the greenhouse provides flexibility with how the greenhouse is used. Grow lights, heat 
pads, fans and heaters all require electricity.   
Water – Easy access to a hose will save time and labor. 
Gas – Another option for a heat source. Proper ducting and ventilation is required. 
 
Accessories – 
Heaters – Even a Cool Greenhouse may need some heat to keep temperatures above freezing. Supplementary 
heat can be as simple as a space heater or solar mass. To provide warmer temperatures, a 220 V circuit may be 
required. 
Thermometers – A minimum/maximum thermometer will monitor the high and low temperatures.  
Thermometers with blue tooth can immediately alert you when temperatures are too low or too high.  
Air circulation and temperature control – Providing good air flow is important for healthy plants. Place vents on 
the roof and lower in the greenhouse so air can move through and escape on hot days. A fan circulates air to 
improve heating in the winter and cooling in the summer.  
Seed Starting Mats warm the growing medium to speed up germination. 
Lighting comes in a variety of installation and bulb options. Lights that are hued toward the blue spectrum 
promote foliage, lights toward the red spectrum promote blooming. When starting seeds, light fixtures should be 
placed approximately 4” from the surface of the growing medium, then raised as the seedlings grow.

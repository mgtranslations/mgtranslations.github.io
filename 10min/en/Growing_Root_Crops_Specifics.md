## Growing Root Crops Specifics  

### Growing Bulbs  

#### Garlic  
- **Planting:**  
  - Plant garlic bulbs August–October for optimum results.  
  - Divide the bulb into individual cloves.  
  - Plant cloves 3” deep, 6” apart, pointy end up.  
- **Care:**  
  - Water until winter rains begin or during dry periods.  
  - Keep beds free of weeds.  
  - Fertilize mid-season with a balanced fertilizer.  
- **Harvesting:**  
  - Garlic scapes (flower buds) can be harvested and eaten mid-summer.  
  - Reduce water in late July.  
  - Leaves will begin to dry and brown in mid-August.  
  - Use a garden fork to gently loosen the roots and pull up the plant.  
  - Lay garlic out in a cool, dry location for a few weeks.  
  - Trim leaves and cut off roots.  

#### Onions  
- **Planting:**  
  - Plant onion sets in March when it is cool.  
  - Plant 2–3” apart, pointy end up.  
- **Care:**  
  - Moist and cool conditions are preferred early in development.  
  - Thin plants as they develop to promote bigger onions.  
  - Fertilize mid-season with a balanced fertilizer.  
  - Developing onions prefer warm and dry conditions.  
- **Harvesting:**  
  - Harvest when green tops topple over and begin to brown.  
  - Reduce water at this point.  
  - Use a garden fork to gently loosen the roots and pull.  
  - Brush off soil and lay onions elevated in a cool, dry location for 1–2 weeks.  
  - Trim leaves and cut off roots.  

#### Leeks  
- **Planting:**  
  - Start seeds indoors in late February or early March (8–10 weeks before the last frost) in shallow trays of seedling mix soil.  
  - After germination, move seedlings to a cold frame to develop.  
  - After the threat of frost, plant leek seedlings one per 6” deep hole, 8–10 inches apart.  
  - Do not fill the hole with soil; allow soil to gradually fill with gentle watering.  
- **Care:**  
  - Mulch or compost can be added once actively growing.  
  - Burying them deep helps blanch the stalks and make them tender.  
  - Provide consistent moisture to the root zone.  
  - Apply all-purpose fertilizer halfway through the growing season.  
- **Harvesting:**  
  - Leeks can be harvested at any stage of development.  
  - Use a garden fork 4 inches from the base to loosen soil and pull plants out one at a time.  
  - Trim off roots and cut leaves 5 inches above the white/light green stem.  
  - The edible part, called the “shank,” consists of layers of fleshy stems.

### Growing Rhizomes  

#### Ginger or Turmeric  
- **Planting:**  
  - Propagate from a healthy, plump rhizome.  
  - Cut the rhizome into 1–1½-inch pieces and let them heal for a few days.  
  - Soak rhizomes overnight if treated with growth retardant.  
  - Plant rhizomes in March, growth nodes pointing upward, 2–4 inches apart, and cover with 3 inches of potting soil in a pot.  
- **Care:**  
  - Keep plants in warm and moist conditions to mimic tropical origins.  
  - Transplant outdoors or into a garden in June.  
  - Rhizomes grow horizontally during summer but should be harvested or moved indoors before frost.  
- **Harvesting:**  
  - Ginger plants grow 2–3 feet tall.  
  - Harvest partially or fully using a garden fork to loosen rhizomes/roots.  
  - Break off rhizome portions and pull off leaves.  
  - Store rhizomes in the freezer or refrigerator.  
  - Leaves can be dried for tea.

### Growing Tap Roots  

#### Carrots, Radishes, Beets, and Parsnips  
- **Planting:**  
  - Plant seeds early in spring when soil is about 40°F or late summer for a fall crop.  
  - Follow seed packet instructions for spacing.  
- **Care:**  
  - Keep soil evenly moist, especially during germination.  
  - Water consistently and deeply during the growing season.  
  - Thin young seedlings for root development (per seed packet).  
  - Parsnips need nitrogen-rich fertilizer mid-season; other crops require moderate feeding with emphasis on phosphorus and potassium.  
- **Harvesting:**  
  - Radishes: 21–35 days.  
  - Beets: 50–65 days.  
  - Carrots: 65–90 days (220 days if overwintered).  
  - Parsnips: 100 days before summer heat.  
  - Harvest by gently pulling the base of greens upward.  
  - Rinse soil and store in a cool, moist refrigerator.

### Growing Tuberous Roots  

#### Sweetpotatoes  
- **Planting:**  
  - Grow from “slips” in early April.  
  - Place a sweetpotato in a cardboard box with damp sand, cover with 2” of sand, and leave in a warm area.  
  - Check for sprouting; slips should be firm, green, and 8–12 inches long with one or two leaves.  
  - Plant slips cut-end down, 4–5 inches deep, and 9–15 inches apart.  
  - Rows should be 3–4 feet apart.  
- **Care:**  
  - Water immediately after transplanting to promote root formation.  
  - Maintain even soil moisture.  
- **Harvesting:**  
  - Sweetpotatoes mature in 90–120 days.  
  - Harvest in late summer to early fall before soil temperatures drop below 60°F.  
  - Harvest and store similarly to potatoes.

### Growing Tubers  

#### Potatoes  
- **Planting:**  
  - Plant in late March or early April.  
  - Cut large seed potatoes into pieces (about 2 ounces) with 2–3 eyes each; air-dry for a few days to heal wounds.  
  - In loose, well-drained soil, dig holes 2’ deep, 12” wide, and 3’ apart.  
  - Place seed potato in the hole and cover with 4–6” of soil.  
  - For hard soil, dig shallow 6” holes and loosen the base and sides. Cover with 4–6” of soil.  
- **Care:**  
  - As sprouts emerge with foliage in 3–4 weeks, add 12” of a mixture of soil, compost, or hay to cover. Repeat at least once more to encourage tuber formation.  
- **Harvesting:**  
  - Early varieties: 9–12 weeks.  
  - Late varieties: 14–17 weeks (after plants have blossomed).  
  - Use a garden fork at least 6” from the plant to loosen soil; digging and searching by hand is another technique.  
  - Brush off soil (do not wash) and store in a cool, dry place.

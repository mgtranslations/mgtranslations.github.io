Growing Root Crops Specifics 
Growing Bulbs   
Plant Garlic Bulbs August-October is optimum. Divide the bulb into individual cloves. Plant 3” deep, 
6” apart, pointy end up. Water until winter rains begin or during dry periods. Keep beds free of 
weeds. Fertilize mid-season with a balanced fertilizer. Garlic scapes (flower buds) can be harvested 
and eaten mid-summer. Reduce water late July. Leaves will begin to dry and brown in  mid-August. 
Use a garden fork to gently loosen the roots and gently pull up plant. Lay garlic out in a cool, dry 
location for a few weeks. Trim up leaves and cut off roots.   
Plant Onion Sets in March when it is cool. Plant 2-3” apart, pointy end up. Plants prefer moist and 
cool conditions early in development. As they develop, thinning will promote bigger onions. Fertilize 
mid-season with a balanced fertilizer. Developing onions like warm and dry conditions. Harvest when 
green tops topple over and begin to brown. Reduce water at this point. Use a garden fork to gently 
loosen the roots and pull. Brush off soil and lay onions elevated in a cool, dry location for a week or 
two. Trim up leaves and cut off roots. 
Leeks grown from seeds are best started, late February or early March (8-10 weeks before the last 
frost), indoors in shallow trays of seedling mix soil. After germination, seedlings can be moved to a 
cold frame to develop. After threat of frost, leek seedlings can be planted one seedling per 6” deep 
hole, 8-10 inches apart. Do not fill the hole with soil. Allow soil to gradually fill with gentle watering. 
Mulch or compost can be added once they are actively growing.  Burying them deep helps to blanch 
the stalks and make them tender.  Provide consistent moisture to root zone and apply all-purpose 
fertilizer halfway through the growing season. Leeks can be harvested at any stage of development. 
Use a garden fork, 4 inches from base to loosen soil and pull plants out, one at a time. Trim off roots, 
cut off leaves 5 inches above white/light green stem with an arrow like shape to the tip. The edible 
part is called the “shank” and is layers of fleshy stems. This structure and growing pattern make it a 
bulb.       
 
Growing Rhizomes  
Ginger or Turmeric can be propagated from a piece of healthy, plump ginger or turmeric rhizome. Cut 
the rhizome into 1- to 1½-inch pieces and set them aside for a few days to heal. Rhizomes may have 
been treated with a growth retardant so soak them in water overnight. Plant the rhizomes in March, 
growth nodes pointing upward, 2-4 inches apart and cover with 3 inches of potting soil in a pot. Keep 
developing plants in warm and moist growing conditions, to mimic its tropical origin. From its nodes, a 
rhizome can grow roots, branch to create other plantlets, and send up shoots. The plant can go 
outside or be transplanted into a garden in June. The rhizome will grow horizontally in the pot or 
garden during the summer but should be harvested or moved indoors before frost. Ginger plants will 
grow to about 2 to 3 feet tall. Harvesting can be partial or the whole plant. Use a garden fork to gently 
loosen the rhizome/roots, break off rhizome portion and pull off leaves. Store rhizome in freezer or 
refrigerator. Leaves can be dried for tea. 
 

 
 
Growing Tap Roots  
Carrots, Radishes, Beets and Parsnips are cool crops, meaning they can be planted early when soil is 
about 40 degrees in the spring and late summer for a fall crop. Plant and space seeds according to 
seed packet. Keep soil evenly moist, especially during germination, and water consistently deep 
during growing season. Thinning young seedlings is essential for root development (per seed packet). 
Harvesting of baby root vegetables achieves this goal. Parsnips need nitrogen rich fertilizer mid-
season. Other crops, feed moderately with emphasis on phosphorus and potassium. Harvest time 
depends on plant variety with radishes ready as early as 21-35 days, beets 50-65 days, carrots 65-90 
days (220 overwintered), parsnips 100 days before summer heat sets in. Harvest by gently hand 
pulling the base of greens and tugging upward. Rinse soil and store in a cool moist refrigerator.  
 
Growing Tuberous Roots 
Sweetpotatoes are grown from “slips” that grow into a vigorous vine plant. In early April, put a 
sweetpotato in a cardboard box with damp sand, cover with 2” of sand. Close lid and leave in a warm 
area. Check for sprouting. A good sweetpotato slip should be firm, green, and 8 to 12 inches long, 
preferably with one or two leaves. Plant slips with the cut end down 4 to 5 inches deep and 9 to 15 
inches apart. Rows should be 3 to 4 feet apart. Plants should be watered immediately after they are 
transplanted in order to promote roots to form on slips. Maintain even soil moisture.  Sweetpotato 
varieties vary in days to maturity, but most range between 90 and 120 days. Sweetpotatoes should be 
harvested in the late summer to early fall before soil temperatures drop below 60°F. Harvest and 
storage is similar to potatoes.  
 
Growing Tubers 
Plant Potatoes in late March or early April. To prepare them, cut large seed potato into several pieces 
(about 2 ounces), each having 2-3 eyes (dormant buds), then air-dry for a few days to heal wounds. In 
loose, well-drained soil, dig holes 2’ deep 12” wide and 3’ apart. Place seed potato in hole and cover 
with 4-6” of soil. If garden soil is hard, dig shallow 6” holes with base and sides forked and loosened. 
Cover with 4-6” of soil. As the potato sprouts emerge with foliage in 3-4 weeks, add 12” of a mixture 
of soil, compost or hay to cover. Continue this at least one more time to encourage tuber formation. 
Early varieties can be harvested in 9-12 weeks, late varieties in 14-17 weeks. Always after plants have 
blossomed. To harvest, fork soil at least 6” from plant; digging and searching with your hands is 
another technique. Brush off soil (do not wash) and store in a cool dry place.

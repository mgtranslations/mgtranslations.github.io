## About Great Plant Picks

Great Plant Picks (GPP) is the primary educational program of the Elisabeth C. Miller Botanical Garden. In 2001, the first list debuted with recommendations for building a comprehensive palette of outstanding plants for the maritime Pacific Northwest. To date, over 1,000 exceptional plants have been selected for gardeners living west of the Cascade Mountains from Eugene, Oregon, USA to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

### Selection Criteria

GPP plants selected for this list meet the following criteria:

- Can live in a variety of soils.
- Require moderate or less supplemental water.
- Can tolerate heat.
- Are cold hardy in USDA zone 7.
- Are not prone to disease or pest problems.
- Offer more than one season of interest in the garden.

Many GPP plants also provide ecological benefits, such as supporting pollinators, providing bird food, and offering habitat for wildlife.

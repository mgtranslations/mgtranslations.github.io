Growing Lettuce & Other Greens
Overview 
Lettuce and leafy greens are wonderful 
crops for new and experienced gardeners alike.  
Their short growing season allows quick results and 
multiple crops per season.  Their low cultural 
requirements make them adaptable to apartment 
balconies as well as backyard gardens.  Their high 
ornamental value makes them an excellent edible 
to tuck into patio containers.  Unlike most 
vegetables, greens can tolerate some shade, and 
growing your own is economical.  A single packet of 
seed contains an average of 2,000 seeds and can 
provide several months’ worth of loose-leaf mix, 
one of the more expensive gourmet items in the 
market. 
 
Common Leafy Vegetables 
• Loose-leaf lettuce: 
Oak Leaf, Red Sails, Salad Bowl 
• Loose-head lettuce: 
Buttercrunch, Bibb, Boston 
• Romaine lettuce: 
Valmaine, Cos 
• Iceberg lettuce: 
Summertime, Red Iceberg 
• Spinach:  
Asian – cool season or broadleaf 
New Zealand – warm season 
Other Greens with Similar Cultural Needs  
• Arugula:  adds a pleasant nutty flavor 
• Mustard:  provides mild spice 
• Bok choy:  best used in stir-fry  
• Swiss chard and kale:  sturdy, cold-hardy 
plants; cook to serve 
 
How to Start 
Lettuce and other greens can be grown 
from either seed or transplants.  The guideline for 
planting seed is to sow them at a depth equal to 2 
to 4 times their width.  In other words, the finer 
the seed, the shallower it should be sown.  Refer to 
the seed packet for additional information. 
Direct sow:  remove all weeds; amend soil, 
if needed.  Level bed, sprinkle lightly with seeds, 
and cover them with ¼ inch soil.  As plants grow, 
thin to avoid overcrowding and to ensure that 
plants left in the bed have room to develop into 
heads.  Young seedlings can be used as “baby 
greens”.  
Transplants:  choose vigorous plants; soak 
well in pots prior to planting to ensure they are 
thoroughly watered.  Loosen roots and plant in the 
ground or a container. 
Container planting:  Containers are ideal 
for growing lettuce and other greens.  Begin with a 
good container mix.  Good loamy garden soil may 
substitute no more than 1/3 of the total mix. 
 For every 2.5 cubic feet of medium without 
added fertilizer, add 1 cup dolomite lime, 1 cup 
cottonseed or alfalfa meal or 2/3 cup blood meal, 2 
cups bone meal or soft rock phosphate, and 1 cup 
kelp meal.   
For ease of harvesting, group crops by 
cultural need and growth habit.   For example, 
lettuce has longer growing season than broccoli.  
Growing them in different containers allows you to 
harvest broccoli weeks before lettuce is done.  The 
container can be used for something else. 
 
When to Plant 
Minimum soil temperature should be 40 to 
45 degrees.  Soil in raised beds and containers will 
reach this temperature earlier than ground soil.  
Use a soil thermometer, available at nurseries and 
garden supply centers, to check your soil 
temperature. 
Leafy greens grow best when air 
temperature is 60 to 70 degrees.  Cooler weather 
 

will not damage plants but will merely slow growth. 
Plant greens in early spring through early 
summer for summer harvest.  For fall harvest, plant 
greens in late summer. 
Hot weather causes greens to bolt or set 
seed.  When this happens, leaves become coarse 
and bitter.  Slow-bolt or long-standing varieties do 
better in summer. 
 
Soil 
Greens are adaptable to various soil types; 
however, heavy clay soils should be amended with 
compost or sand to ensure good drainage.  Lettuce 
grown in wet conditions is susceptible to white 
mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum). 
Greens require approximately 1 inch of 
water per week; water greens frequently to keep 
soil moist.  If you choose to water overhead, be 
sure to allow the leaves to dry before evening. 
 
Fertilizer  
Greens have shallow roots and need only 7 
to 8 inches of fertile soil.  Apply a nitrogen fertilizer 
at a rate of 0.2 pounds per 100 square feet. 
 
Slugs 
Moist, shaded soil beneath lettuce plants 
and sweet, tender leaves create a perfect 
environment for slugs.  Slugs can be handled in 
several environmentally-friendly manners.  Cutting 
them in half with scissors is easy.  Traps made of 
small tins such as tuna fish  
cans, recessed so the upper edge is slightly higher 
than the soil and filled with beer, attract slugs. 
If using commercial slug bait, make sure 
that it is safe for pets and other animals that may 
visit your garden.  
  
Harvesting and Storing 
Harvest greens in the morning before leaves 
begin to wilt.  Harvest “baby greens” by snipping 
the entire plant at ground level, leaving enough 
room between remaining plants to develop into 
heads.  To harvest from heads, either snip the 
entire plant at ground level or pinch off only outer 
leaves.  Leaving the inner leaves allows the plant to 
continue producing. 
Right after harvest, refresh lettuce by 
soaking in a basin of cool water for 15 minutes.  
Spin or drain well, seal tightly, and refrigerate for 
up to three days. 
To cook Swiss chard or kale, trim out the 
center rib which can be tough or bitter.  Chop 
leaves and sauté in a small amount of olive oil.  
Garlic, salt, and pepper are all good additions.  
Center ribs are good in soup or stew.

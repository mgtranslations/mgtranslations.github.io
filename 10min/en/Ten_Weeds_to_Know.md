## Ten Weeds to Know  

A weed is a plant that is a hazard or a nuisance or one that causes injury to people, animals, or a desired crop. In the home garden, weeds can:  
- Compete with desirable crops  
- Reduce the attractiveness of a landscape  
- Be a source of allergy or poison for humans or animals  
- Harbor diseases, rodents, and insect pests

## How to Control Weeds  

Knowing your weeds helps identify the most effective ways to control them:  
- **Annual weeds** grow for one season. Remove them before they compete with crops and/or set seeds.  
- **Perennial weeds** live many years. Effective removal requires digging up their roots or killing them with systemic herbicide. They also spread by seeds.  

### Methods for Weed Control  
1. **Exclusion**  
   - Closely examine items you bring into the garden, such as compost, soil, and plants.  
   - Patrol your property against creeping weeds from neighbors.  

2. **Cultural and Mechanical Controls**  
   - Weed early and often to prevent weeds from establishing.  
   - Keep weeds from going to seed.  
   - Rotate vegetable plants and plant cover crops to reduce weeds.  

3. **Mulching**  
   - Suppresses weeds.  
   - Common organic mulches: shredded bark, leaves, compost, newspapers.  
   - Synthetic mulches: plastic, landscape fabrics.  

4. **Watering**  
   - Water only desired plants using drip irrigation or targeted hand watering to reduce weed growth.  

5. **Herbicides** (as a last resort)  
   - Follow instructions on the label.  
   - **Terminology Guide**:  
     - *Pre-emergent herbicides*: Used before weeds sprout.  
     - *Post-emergent herbicides*: Used after weeds are up.  
     - *Selective herbicides*: Control certain plants and not others.  
     - *Non-selective herbicides*: Can damage many types of plants.  
     - *Systemic herbicides*: Move from the point of application to other parts of the plant.  
     - *Non-systemic/contact herbicides*: Affect only the part of the plant they touch.

## Common Weeds in Our Region  

### Dandelion (*Asteraceae*) – Perennial  
- **Description**: Small yellow flowers on top of a stalk; thrives in moist sites.  
- **Control**: Hand remove the entire tap root (deep and branching) before the plant goes to seed. In lawns, follow up by seeding the area to minimize weed incursion in bare ground.  

### Clover (*Trifolium*, *Medicago*, and *Melilotus*) – Some Annual, Some Perennial  
- **Description**: Tap roots and clover-shaped leaves; creeping forms can spread into large patches.  
- **Control**: Hand remove the tap roots before they go to seed. Apply mulch to suppress germination as seeds have hard protective covers.  

### Quackgrass (*Elytrigia repens*) – Perennial  
- **Description**: Erect, clump-forming grass that grows up to 4 feet; reproduces by seeds and underground creeping stems (rhizomes).  
- **Control**: Increase nitrogen fertilization and mowing. Very difficult to remove mechanically.  

### Annual Bluegrass (*Poa annua*) – Annual  
- **Description**: Flattened stems, erect or spreading, 2–12 inches long; sometimes forms dense clumps. Flowering and seed production occur March–August.  
- **Control**: Hoe or hand pull before seeds form. Hard to control in lawns.  

### English Ivy (*Hedera helix*) – Perennial  
- **Description**: Reproduces by seed and stolon; stems growing up trees form fruits spread by birds.  
- **Control**: Hand dig or pull. Cut ivy plants already in trees at waist height and dig up the roots.  

### Creeping Buttercup (*Ranunculus repens*) – Perennial  
- **Description**: Grows up to 1 foot tall; spreads by stolon and seed; forms thick carpets on wet, poorly drained soils. Leaves are dark green with light patches, divided into three toothed leaflets. Flowers are glossy, bright yellow.  
- **Control**: In lawns, improve drainage, avoid compaction, and promote healthy grass by overseeding and fertilizing. Hand remove all runners, roots, and growing points between fall and spring when soil is moist.  

### Curly Dock (*Rumex crispus L.*) – Perennial  
- **Description**: Robust tap-rooted perennial, 2–5 feet tall; large basal leaves with curly or wavy margins; flowers and plant turn reddish-brown at maturity.  
- **Control**: Dig up the entire root before it goes to seed. Check for new growth from root remnants and continue to remove new plants.  

### Field Bindweed/Morning Glory (*Convolvulus arvensis L.*) – Perennial  
- **Description**: Dense tangled mats of arrowhead-shaped leaves and bell-shaped white to pinkish flowers; long, deep taproot (up to 10 feet) with running rootstocks closer to the surface. Seeds remain viable for up to 50 years.  
- **Control**: Hand pull top growth weekly, pull rootstocks where possible, and prevent seed formation. Spray systemic herbicide in late summer to early fall.  

### Little Bittercress (*Cardamine oligosperma*) – Winter Annual or Biennial  
- **Description**: Plants range from 3–12 inches tall; branched, smooth stems emerge from the soil line; leaves form a rosette. Small white flowers on stalks. Mature seed pods "shoot off" seeds several yards away.  
- **Control**: Hand remove before seeds form. Apply a 2–3 inch layer of mulch in late summer to suppress seed germination.  

### Crabgrass (*Digitaria ischaemum*) – Annual  
- **Description**: Low-growing summer annual grass; spreads by seed and occasional rooting of the lowest joints of stems. Common in vegetable gardens, landscape beds, and gravel driveways.  
- **Control**: Remove before it sets seed. Hand remove the clump, including roots.

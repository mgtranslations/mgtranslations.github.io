Ten Weeds to Know 
 
A weed is a plant that is a hazard or a nuisance or one that causes injury to people, animals or a desired crop. 
In the home garden, they could compete with desirable crops, reduce the attractiveness of a landscape, be a 
source for allergy or poison for humans or animals, or harbor diseases, rodents and insect pests. 
 
How to Control Weeds 
Knowing your weeds helps identify the most effective ways to control them. Annual weeds grow one season 
so the key is to remove them before they compete with crops and/or set seeds. Perennial weeds live many 
years and effective removal requires digging up their roots or killing them with systemic herbicide. They also 
spread by seeds. 
Excluding weeds by closely examining items you bring into the garden. This may include compost, soil, and 
plants.  Patrol your property against creeping weeds from neighbors. 
Using cultural and mechanical controls: Weed early and often so they do not get a foothold. Keep weeds 
from going to seed.  Rotating vegetable plants and planting cover crops can reduce weeds.  
Mulching suppresses weeds. Common organic mulches include shredded bark or leaves, compost, and 
newspapers. Synthetic mulches include plastic or landscape fabrics. 
Watering only desired plants, such as with drip irrigation or targeted hand watering, will reduce weed 
growth. 
Applying herbicides as a last resort.  Be sure to follow instructions on the label.  A quick guide to some 
terminologies: 
• Pre-emergent herbicides are used before weeds sprout.   
• Post-emergent herbicides are used after weeds are up.   
• Selective herbicides control certain plants and not others.   
• Non-selective herbicides potentially can damage many types of plant.   
• Systemic herbicides move from the point of initial application to other parts of the plant.  
• Non-systemic or contact herbicides affect only the part of the plant they touch.   
 
Common Weeds in Our Region 
Dandelion (Asteraceae) – Perennial   
Dandelion is a perennial with small yellow flowers on top of a stalk. It thrives in moist sites.  Control: Hand 
remove the entire tap root, which can be deep and branching, before plant goes to seed. In lawns, follow up 
by seeding the area to minimize weed incursion in bare ground.  
 
Clover (Trifolium, Medicago, and Melilotus) – Some annual, some perennial 
All clovers have tap roots and clover-shape leaves. Creeping forms can spread into large patches.  Control: 
Hand remove the tap roots before they go to seed. Seeds have hard protective covers and can be difficult to 
kill; apply mulch to suppress germination. 
 
Quackgrass (Elytrigia repens) - Perennial  
Quackgrass is erect, can form clumps, and grows to almost 4 feet. Reproduces by seeds and with 
underground, creeping stems (rhizomes). Control: Increase nitrogen fertilization and mowing.  It is very 
difficult to remove by mechanical means.   
 
 

 
Annual Bluegrass (Poa annua) – Annual  
Annual bluegrass has flattened stems that are erect or spreading.  They are 2 to 12 inches long, sometimes 
forming dense clumps.  The flowering and seed production period is March to August.  Control: Hoe or hand 
pull before seeds form. Hard to control in lawns.  
 
English Ivy (Hedera helix) - Perennial 
English ivy reproduces by seed and by stolon. Stems growing up trees will form fruits which can be spread by 
birds. Control: Hand dig or pull. Cut ivy plants already in trees at waist height and dig up the roots.  
 
Creeping Buttercup (Ranunculus repens) – Perennial 
This competitive plant grows up to one foot tall, spreads by stolon and seed and forms thick carpets on wet, 
poorly drained soils everywhere. Leaves are dark green with light patches and are divided into three toothed 
leaflets. Flowers are glossy, bright yellow.  Control:  In lawns, improve drainage, avoid compaction, and 
promote healthy grass by overseeding and fertilizing as needed. Hand remove all of the runners, roots and 
growing points. Doing so between fall and spring, when soil is moist, is most effective.   
 
Curly Dock (Rumex crispus L.) - Perennial 
This robust tap-rooted perennial grows to 2 – 5 feet tall and has large, mostly basal, leaves with curly or wavy 
margins. The flowers and even the entire plant can turn reddish-brown at maturity.  Curly dock can generate 
a new plant from a small piece of cut root. Prolific seeder. Control: Dig up the entire root (may be difficult) 
before it goes to seed. Check for new growth from root remnants and continue to remove new plants. 
 
Field Bindweed/Morning Glory (Convolvulus arvensis L.) - Perennial 
Field bindweed often forms dense tangled mats of arrowhead-shaped leaves and bell-shaped, white to 
pinkish flowers. Long, deep taproot can reach a depth of 10 feet with running roots rootstocks closer to the 
surface.  Seeds remain viable for up to 50 years. Control: Hand pull top growth weekly (or more often), pull 
rootstocks where possible,  and don’t let it go to seed. Spray systemic herbicide in late summer to early fall. 
 
Little Bittercress (Cardamine oligosperma) – Winter Annual or biennial 
Plants range from 3 to 12 inches tall, with branched, smooth stems emerging from the soil line. Leaves 
radiate from the base of the stem to form a rosette. Small white flowers on stalks. When seed pods mature, 
seeds are “shot off” to several yards away. Control: Hand remove before seeds form.  Apply a 2 to 3-inch 
layer of mulch in infested area in late summer to suppress seeds from germination.  
 
Crabgrass (Digitaria ischaemum) -- Annual 
Crabgrass is a common weed in vegetable gardens, landscape beds, and gravel driveways.  It is a low-
growing, summer annual grass that spreads by seed and from occasional rooting of the lowest joints of the 
stems. Control: Control before it sets seed. Hand remove the clump including roots.

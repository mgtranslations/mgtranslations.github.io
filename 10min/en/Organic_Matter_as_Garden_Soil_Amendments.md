## Organic Matter as Garden Soil Amendments  
Soil amendments can improve soil structure, increase fertility, and enhance water retention. Amendments should be low in chemical salts and contain enough nitrogen to feed plants and soil microbes. To benefit plants, amend the entire planting bed. If that is not practical, backfill new plantings with native soil. Filling the planting hole with added compost and other amendments creates an interface (where two soil types come together) with native soil, which impedes movement of air, water, and roots.

## Assess Needs  

### Test Your Soil  
It is important to begin with a baseline before making changes. A routine test will measure soil texture, organic matter, nutrient levels, pH, and other properties. Additional tests can assess heavy metal contamination, soil biology, or other attributes. If you only want to know the soil pH, a test kit from the garden center may suffice. In Oregon, some Master Gardener™ associations, including Clackamas County, offer free soil pH tests.

### Amend Based on Test Results  
- **Adjusting Soil pH**: Change comes slowly.  
- **Maintaining Organic Matter**: Organic amendments must be added as part of an overall program—organic matter is not “one and done.”  
- **Nutrient Deficiency**:  
  - For annual crops, fertilize as recommended.  
  - For landscape plants, delay fertilizing if plants appear healthy and show normal growth (nutrient deficiency often stunts growth).

## Organic Amendment Materials  

### Yard Waste Compost  
- Compost made from yard debris is a common source of organic amendments. Using yard waste compost recycles local materials.  
- You can make your own: [Gardening with Compost](https://cmastergardeners.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/gardening-with-compost.pdf).  
- The quality of commercial compost varies depending on the source materials and how it is made. The US Composting Council has a Seal of Testing Assurance (STA) program: [http://tmecc.org/sta/index.html](http://tmecc.org/sta/index.html).  
- Commercial composters participating in this program must test their products for pathogens, heavy metals, and pesticides on a regular basis and make results available upon request.  

**Note**:  
- Any compost can be a source of weed seeds.  
- Occasionally, commercial compost can contain persistent herbicide residues. Before using compost, run your own bioassay by planting pea seeds and observing if they germinate and grow normally: [Clopyralid Bioassay](https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/411/2014/12/PDF_Clopyralid_Bioassay.pdf).  

**Application**:  
- If bioassay results are favorable, add 1–3 inches of compost and mix into the soil when making a new bed.  
- Annual additions of ¼ to ½ inch of compost can maintain soil organic matter and fertility.  
- Compost contains low levels of nitrogen, which is released slowly.

### Peat Moss  
No longer recommended due to the environmental damage from peat harvest.  

---

### Coco Fiber (Coir)  
- A byproduct of coconut harvesting, often used in container media.  
- May be a source of high salt, depending on how it was processed.

### Biosolids  
- By-products of municipal wastewater treatment containing nutrients, organic matter, and inorganic content.  
- Class A biosolids are treated to reduce pathogens and are suitable for use in gardens and landscapes.

### Manure  
- An age-old soil amendment with higher levels of nutrients and salts than yard waste compost.  
- Contains potassium and phosphorus (N and K), which are often unnecessary in home gardens or landscapes.  
- Raw manure may contain weed seeds and pathogens. Use composted manure to reduce risk.  

**Application**:  
- Apply in spring, two weeks before planting.  
- Avoid fall applications to reduce the risk of nutrient leaching and water pollution.

### Coffee Grounds  
- Can be used as a soil amendment by working ½ inch into the top 4 inches of soil.  
- pH: 6.5–6.8.  
- Decomposes slowly and contains low levels (1–2%) of nitrogen and some micronutrients.  
- May require additional nitrogen fertilizer to compensate.  
- Stimulates soil microbe activity, which can tie up soil nitrogen.  

**Note**: Test in a small area before use, as coffee grounds may inhibit the growth of some plants.

### Biochar  
- Made by heating biomass (e.g., wood chips, crop residues, dairy manure) under low oxygen conditions.  
- Properties vary depending on source material and production temperature.  
- Typically contains 50–80% carbon and has a high pH.

### Cover Crop  
- Green manures or cover crops can be incorporated into the soil or harvested and laid on the soil surface as mulch.  
- Benefits:  
  - Increase soil organic matter.  
  - Reduce erosion.  
  - May add nitrogen.  
  - Promote soil aggregation.  

**Planning**: Success requires sowing and killing cover crops at the right time to avoid competition with vegetable gardens.

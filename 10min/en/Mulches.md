## Seminar Recommendations

- Apply to most ornamental gardens and landscapes
- Are based on appropriate, current plant and soil science

## Unmanaged Urban Soils ...

- Are heavily compacted: poor water and air movement
- Have abrupt layers
- Often have low organic matter
- Need to be tested before selecting plants or adding amendments

## Compaction

- Created by vehicles, people & animals
- Reduces water and air movement, and therefore root movement

## An Ideal Landscape Mulch Will...

- Enhance water infiltration and retention
- Moderate soil temperatures
- Improve soil structure
- Neutralize pollutants
- Suppress pathogens and pests
- Not detract from aesthetics of landscape
- Enhance gas transfer
- Reduce erosion and compaction
- Provide mineral nutrients
- Enhance beneficial microbes and insects
- Be cheap, easy to find, and easy to apply

## Mulches

- **Living:** Cover crops, ground covers
- **Synthetic:** Geotextiles, plastics, rubber
- **Inorganic:** Brick, decomposed granite, lava rock, stone pavers, tumbled glass
- **Organic:** Bark, coir, compost, leaves, nutshells, pine needles, straw, wood chips

### Synthetic Mulches

- Not a permanent solution to weed control
- Can damage health of landscape system
- Sheet mulches reduce water and gas transport
- Rubber mulches are flammable and may leach harmful chemicals
- Best used for crop production or where no plant material is desired

### Problems with Cardboard & Newspaper Sheet Mulches

- Can induce anaerobic conditions if used on wet, poorly drained soils
- Will become hydrophobic if allowed to dry out
- Can become pest havens for termites and rodents

### Effectiveness of Inorganic and Organic Mulches (Numerous Studies)

- Weed control improves with mulch depth
- Permeability increases with mulch coarseness
- Greatest benefits and fewest drawbacks with deep, coarse mulches

### Decomposition of Organic Mulches Dependent on Environment

- Moisture (more moisture = faster decomposition)
- Temperature (warmer temperature = faster decomposition)
- Soil microbe population (diverse population = faster decomposition)

### Decomposition of Organic Mulches Dependent on C:N Ratio

- Grass clippings, leaves, manures: Rapid (days to weeks)
- Composts: Moderate (about six months)
- Wood chips, hardwood bark, peat: Slow (up to several years)
- High cellulose and phenolic content will decrease decomposition rate
- Replacement rate depends on decomposition rate

### Organic Mulches Can...

- Provide a slow release of macro- and micro-nutrients
- Improve soil structure by reducing compaction
- Enhance establishment of trees and shrubs in low-maintenance landscapes
- Enhance beneficial microbes, which can outcompete many pathogens in healthy soils
- Enhance soil macrofauna biodiversity

### Basic Comparisons Between Inorganic and Organic Mulches

- **Inorganic:**
    - Good choice for regions where water is limited and organic matter is naturally low
    - Low replacement rate, but also does not contribute nutrients to the soil
- **Organic:**
    - Good choice for regions where water availability ensures optimal OM level (5-10%)
    - Decomposition requires continual replacement

### Problems with Fine-Textured Mulches

- Includes sawdust and some composts
- Deep applications will lead to anaerobic soil conditions
- Often become compacted into impervious layers

### Problems with Compost

- Possibility of toxic plant materials or byproducts
- If too much of a nutrient source is added to a landscape, excess nutrients contaminate watersheds. Phosphate in particular requires monitoring.
- Contamination with broadleaf herbicides can injure or kill ornamentals
- Unregulated compost can contain pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxins that may be harmful to you and your plants (e.g. mercury accumulations in golf course turf)

### Using Compost as a Mulch

- Choose those that have been analyzed and certified, or that you make yourself with contaminant-free materials
- Use thin layers to reduce problems associated with fine-textured mulches and with nutrient overload
- Cover the compost layer with a coarser organic mulch to prevent erosion and weed establishment (the "mulch sandwich")

### Problems with Coarse Woody Mulches


- Bark mulch can be contaminated with salt or weed seeds
- Bark contains waxes that prevent absorption and release of water in landscapes
- Softwood bark mulches are often not "people friendly" due to tiny, sharp fibers


- Concerns about high carbon:nitrogen ratio â€“ will this cause a nitrogen deficiency?
- Will diseased wood transfer pathogens if it is used for chips?


- Wood chip mulches have a high C:N ratio, leading to a localized nitrogen deficiency at the mulch-soil interface
- Wood chip mulches do not cause nitrogen deficiency in established plants
- High C:N ratio in wood chips probably prevents germination of some weed seeds


- Armillaria, Cytospora, Thyronectria and Verticillium can all survive on large wood segments for months
- Survival is enhanced if wood chips are incorporated into soil
- No evidence that pathogens in mulch can infect roots below the soil surface


- Fungal species in wood chips are generally decomposers, not pathogens
- In healthy (aerobic) soils, beneficial fungi probably out-compete pathogenic fungi
- Healthy plants are not susceptible to opportunistic pathogens

## Wood Chip Mulches for Landscapes

### Weed Suppression by Wood Chips

- Highly effective - better than herbicides
- Cost-effective low to no cost materials

### How Do Wood Chips Inhibit Weeds?

- Inhibit weeds through allelopathic chemicals
- Decrease nitrogen levels at soil interface
- Reduce light needed by photodormant seeds
- Reduce light availability to buried leaves
- Depth is critical - less than 3" and weed increase

### Mulch Strategies Using Coarse Organic Materials

- Fresh wood chips have the highest nutrient content
- Begin mulch application before annual weeds are established (spring or fall)
- Remove perennial weeds in early spring when root resources are lowest
- Prune or mow perennial weeds at root crown; pulling destroys soil structure
- Remove all noxious weed materials from site to prevent rerooting
- Thick layers (6-8" for ornamental sites, 8-12" for restoration sites and blackberry/ivy control) of coarse materials are best for weed control and water conservation
- Keep mulch away from trunks of trees and shrubs
- Pull any resprouting plants; the mulch layer prevents erosion and facilitates pulling
- Replace mulch as needed to maintain appropriate depth (minimum depth of 4 inches for weed control). This depends on decomposition rate

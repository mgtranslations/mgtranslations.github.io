### Notes

* Planting dates listed are considered safe dates on average years.
* Weather, microclimate, and season extension can allow planting 2-4 weeks earlier or later.
* Dates listed for Region 2 (western valleys) may be extended 7-10 days for the Medford area.
* **DS**: Direct Seed; consider overseeding with thinning or use a precision planter.
* **TP**: Transplant when the plant has 1-2 sets of true leaves.
* **(V)**: Cucurbit vines do best direct seeded in warm soil. They can be transplanted 2-3 weeks from germination with care to minimize disturbance of sensitive roots.
* **Soil temp**: Temperature range for germination (°F). Take soil temperatures early in the day for 5+ days in a row.
* **Air temp**: Air temperature range for active plant growth (°F).
* Most direct-seeded crops will require thinning one or more times to reduce the plants to the appropriate spacing. Note, baby greens, carrots, and beets are delicious!
* **Potatoes (DC\*)**: Plant certified disease-free tuber pieces with at least 3-4 eyes. Planting depth is 6" in flat soil and 4" using the hilling method.
* **n/a**: not applicable.
* **(S)**: For many crops, the amount to plant should be divided into several plantings, 1 or 2 weeks apart in succession.

### Crop Season Information

**Cool Season Crops**

* Prefer cool growing temperatures (60°F to 80°F) of spring and fall.
* Most are intolerant of summer heat but tolerate light frosts.
* Leafy and root vegetables prefer full sun but tolerate partial shade.
* Intolerant of reflected heat during summer.
* Spring crops are typically planted 2-4 weeks before the average spring frost date.
* Plants can be planted early through late spring in succession.
* Most are replanted mid-July to mid-August for a fall harvest.
* Quality relates to rapid growth in good soil with frequent light fertilization and constant water.
* Crops become strong-flavored if they become dry.

**Warm Season Crops**

* Prefer warmer summer temperatures (70°F to 95°F) and are intolerant of frost.
* Typically planted after the average spring frost date.
* Plant in full sun.
* Consider using season extension devices (row cover, coldframes) for an early start or late extension.

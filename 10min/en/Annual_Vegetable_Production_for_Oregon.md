### Notes

- Planting dates listed are considered safe dates on average years.
- Weather, microclimate, and season extension can allow planting 2-4 weeks earlier or later.
- Dates listed for Region 2 (western valleys) may be extended 7-10 days for the Medford area.
- **DS**: Direct Seed; consider overseeding with thinning or use a precision planter.
- **TP**: Transplant when the plant has 1-2 sets of true leaves.
- **(V)**: Cucurbit vines do best direct seeded in warm soil. They can be transplanted 2-3 weeks from germination with care to minimize disturbance of sensitive roots.
- **Soil Temp**: Temperature range for germination (°F). Take soil temperatures early in the day for 5+ days in a row.
- **Air Temp**: Air temperature range for active plant growth (°F).
- Most direct-seeded crops will require thinning one or more times to reduce the plants to the appropriate spacing. Note, baby greens, carrots, and beets are delicious!

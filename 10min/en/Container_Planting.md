Container Planting
Overview 
Containers can provide an effective color accent, year-round structure, and fragrance in specific areas of 
a garden. They are ideal for frost-sensitive plants or for those that require special conditions (e.g., rock 
garden, water garden). Containers can lift plants to heights where they can be appreciated up close. For 
gardeners with limited space, containers offer additional room to plant. And for gardeners with too 
many plants or, for those who can’t decide where to place their new acquisitions, containers provide 
good temporary homes. 
 
Types of Containers  
You can choose from many types of containers, of which these are the most common: 
• Clay pots: Inexpensive, but dry out quickly. 
• Terracotta: More costly than clay, but typically last longer and dry out more slowly. 
• Ceramic containers: A broad range of color and shape, but can be easily damaged. 
• Plastic pots: Lightweight and inexpensive, but become brittle with exposure to light.  You can 
prolong the life of a plastic pot by setting it inside a decorative pot. 
• Wood containers: Will ultimately rot; the most resistant woods are cedar and redwood. 
• Tin containers: Rust over time. 
• Whiskey barrel: A good size for shrubs and small trees, but difficult to move. 
 
Another option is to make your own unique containers out of old wheelbarrows, old canners, even old 
shoes or boots. You are limited only by your imagination. Whatever you choose to use as a container, 
always make certain it has drainage holes. 
 
Container sizes are stated according to the top diameter. As a guideline, a 12-inch container works well 
for flowering annuals and perennials.  Anything smaller will dry out very quickly. Larger pots are a good 
choice for shrubs, small trees, and combination plantings. A half barrel can contain a small-scale garden 
of ornamental and/or edible plants; you can feature various flowers bursting with color; herbs for 
cooking or making tea; vegetables for snacks or meals; or a combination thereof. 
 
Planting Media 
Containers should be filled with potting mix or planter mix because these are designed to be coarse-
textured in order to ensure good drainage. In other words, a good potting mix will be light and fluffy.   
Never use garden soil in containers. Its fine-texture stops adequate drainage within the shallow confines 
of a pot. As a result, roots don’t grow well because of insufficient air and your plants fail. Garden soil 
may also bring in disease, insects, and weed seeds. You can mix a slow-release fertilizer into the potting 
mix before you plant. Although some people suggest adding water-retention crystals, research-based 
support for that notion is lacking. 
 

And don’t follow the ill-advised practice of adding a layer of coarse stuff in the bottom of the container 
for drainage. Because of the dynamics of water movement within a container, that coarse material 
under the potting mix will inhibit drainage. 
 
Fertilizer 
The fertilizer elements in a container are flushed out of the pot each time you water. So it’s important to 
add fertilizer when you plant a container. Mix a 3- to 4-month slow-release fertilizer into the potting mix 
before you start. Then, to maintain plants in optimum condition during the growing season, apply a 
water-soluble fertilizer every 2 to 3 weeks, as needed. 
 
Plant Care 
• In general the larger the container, the better your plants are likely to do.   
• Containers limit root space. So, to help plants thrive, you need to water and fertilize more often than 
if the same plants were planted in the ground. You may find that you need to water your containers 
once, or even twice, daily during warm weather. 
• Place the container in a location that is appropriate to the needs of the plants. Protect containers 
from direct sunlight to avoid “cooking” the root ball from the excessive heat. 
• During the growing season, plants in a container require careful and frequent grooming. Prune (trim) 
and deadhead (remove spent flowers) as needed to promote bushy growth and encourage flowers. 
• As plants in the container grow, be willing to remove those that don’t work, and then add 
replacements to keep the container looking good. 
• During the winter, containers may break during a cold spell because water in the potting mix 
expands when it freezes. Protect your plants’ roots from winter’s cold by wrapping the container 
with insulation materials. Alternately, store the pots in a frost-free place such as a shed or garage.   
 
Plant Selection 
• Almost anything that can be planted in the ground can be grown in a container. This includes small 
trees, shrubs, roses, vines, annuals, and perennials, provided the size of container is suitable. 
• When putting together a container, consider plants of varying heights which possess different foliage 
textures, and display blending or contrasting colors in the flowers and/or leaves.  
• Aesthetics is a matter of individual preference. Go for what pleases you. 
• In general, plant annuals in a mass to achieve a strong visual effect, give vegetables room to spread 
as they grow, and make certain trees and shrubs have adequate space for root growth.   
• Plan on repotting long-term plants such as trees and shrubs every 2 or 3 years and prune roots as 
needed. This can be accomplished in two ways. One is to cut away several inches of the root ball, 
then return it to the original container, filling the space with fresh potting mix. Or you can move the 
plant into a container several inches larger than the original, filling the space with fresh potting mix.

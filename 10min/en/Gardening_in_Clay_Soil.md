Gardening in Clay Soil 
Introduction 
Soil comes from decomposed rocks and organic matter. Healthy soil, by volume, should be 45% rock 
minerals, 5% organic matter, 50% pore space for water and air. Among the many important functions of 
soil are: 
• Home for living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, nematodes, protozoa, and earthworms;  
• Anchor for plant roots; 
• Nutrient reservoir to support plant growth; and 
• Repository and purifier of water. 
Sand, silt, and clay are the mineral particles of soil. Sand particles are visible to the eye and feel gritty while 
silt particles are smaller (similar to a particle of white flour) and feel smooth. Both are shaped like 
miniature rocks. Clay particles are invisible to the naked eye and are typically flat. Most soils are a mixture 
of sand, silt and clay. Loam has a mixture of roughly equal portions of all three particles.  
Soil texture reflects the proportion of sand, silt, and clay; good soil structure relies on living organisms 
(bacteria and fungi) and humus (decomposed organic matter) to glue particles together into peds which are 
the building blocks of soil.

What Does Soil Science Tell Us? 
Fertility 
• Clay soils are rich in plant nutrients. Clay particles carry negative charges which hold positively charged 
particles such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron and other plant nutrients. 
Permeability 
• Wet soil and fine-textured soil (those heavy with clay or silt) compact easily. Compacted soils have 
flattened peds which impede movement of water and roots. Compacted clay soil is difficult to restore.  
• Healthy soils have lots of space between peds (macropores) to support movement of water, gases, and 
roots. More macropores lead to better drainage. 
Water-Holding Capacity 
• Small pores or micropores (the space within a ped) give the soil its water-holding capacity.  
Disturbing the Soil  
• Digging and tilling break up peds, but introduces air into the macropores. Excessive tilling reduces the 
functionality of fungal hyphae, kills beneficial nematodes, and usually results in compacted soils.  
Soil Life 
• Soil is teeming with life -- many of which are beneficial to plants. Soils containing higher levels of 
organic matter tend to have more microorganisms. Soil microorganisms are most active between 70°F 
and 100°F while earthworms are most active at about 50°F. 
 

• Plant roots secrete a substance called exudate which contains sugar, vitamins, oxygen and other 
compounds. Exudate attracts microorganisms to the vicinity of plant roots. Studies show exudate 
compositions vary by plant species and shape the fungal community around each plant. 
Beneficial Microbes 
• Rhizobia bacteria capture nitrogen in air for plant use. 
• Beneficial nematodes are highly sensitive to disturbance and many are killed by tillage, often perturbing 
the entire soil food web in a disturbed soil. 
• Many kinds of fungi form beneficial associations (called mycorrhizae) with plant roots. Fungal hyphae 
work like long root hairs to get water and soil nutrients for the plant. Mycorrhizae also improve soil 
structure by aggregating soil particles into peds.  
How to Manage Clay Soil 
Test Your Soil  
• Before adding amendments, test your soil. Fertilize only if soil test shows deficiency or plants don’t 
grow well. Remember that clay is rich in nutrients. In the Willamette Valley, most trees, shrubs, and 
perennials don’t need added fertilizers.  
Keep Living Roots Growing  
• Living plants harvest sun’s energy and support a community of soil microorganisms through their root 
exudates. Studies show that exudates shape the makeup of soil microbes. Growing a diverse variety of 
plants maximizes diversity in soil life which helps build healthy soil. 
Minimize Disturbance  
• Anything that disturbs the soil (walking on it, digging, tilling) can break up or compact peds and reduce 
pore space which is important to permeability and water-holding capacity. 
Keep it Covered  
• Mulch to moderate soil temperature, minimize evaporation, and reduce weed growth. Organic mulch 
breaks down and adds organic matter to soil -- coarser materials allow air flow while denser substances, 
such as cardboard, impede gas exchange. Arborist wood chips (4-6”) is a good mulch – it allows air flow 
and slowly breaks down to add organic matter to soil. 
Feed Soil Microbes 
• Organic matter (OM) is at the bottom of the soil food web; adding OM feeds soil microbes. Choose a 
form that has been properly composted and does not contain undesirable attributes such as high salt or 
heavy metal. OM such as composted leaves and yard waste may be mixed in or a thin layer 1/2 to 1” 
may be laid on top to create an environment that favors microbial activity.  
Make a Planting Bed for This Season 
• If you need a new bed for an annual vegetable crop, mix composted OM into the entire bed. This should 
give you immediate benefits of workable soil and greater fertility. However, such benefits are short-
term in nature because OM will break down quickly, unused nutrients are likely lost, and the soil will 
settle.  
A Change from the Past 
• The mantra of “Just Add Organic Matter!” as the solution to improving clay has been modified. In the 
past, we recommended an initial addition of 2-4” of OM with subsequent, lesser quantities. This has 
changed. Recent studies of urban gardens where OM has been added over years show unhealthy levels 
of phosphate and OM. High phosphate level inhibits plant uptake of iron and development of beneficial 
mycorrhizae, and contributes to pollution of rivers. If buying OM from commercial sources, Oregon 
Department of Agriculture analyzes OM for nutrient content. Check to ensure you buy OM low in 
phosphorus if you have been adding OM to your soil for a long time.

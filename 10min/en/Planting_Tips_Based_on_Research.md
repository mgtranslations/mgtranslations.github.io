Planting Tips Based on Horticultural Research
 
Overview  
The secret to growing healthy and beautiful plants is within reach of every gardener. It begins with 
selecting a suitable site, preparing the soil, following planting instructions, and providing the new plant 
with appropriate care. Select plants well suited to your site’s conditions of sunlight and/or shade. In 
general, flowering and fruiting plants require at least 6 hours of sunlight, while leafy ornamental or 
edibles such as lettuces, spinach and chard do well with less sun or even bright shade.  
Healthy plants tend to have fewer serious pest or disease problems. When invaders attack, plants are 
more likely to resist or tolerate the assault.  
 
Findings from University Research 
Three important findings are selected below because they are not widely known.  
• Finding 1: Shrubs and trees planted in the fall suffer less environmental stress than those planted in 
the spring.  What does this mean? Plant in the fall, especially trees and shrubs that represent a 
significant investment of labor and funds.  The climate of the Willamette Valley offers dry summers 
and wet winters. Fall planting requires less supplemental watering and affords plants a cooler and 
wetter climate to grow.  
 
• Finding 2: The interface between different soil texture classes (for example clay, sand, sandy loam, 
silt) impedes movement of water, roots and nutrients. What does this mean?  Stop gardening 
practices that create interface. Putting gravel in the bottom of a planting hole and filling the hole 
with amended soil are two examples. Both create interfaces and subject roots to grow through 
different soil textures. 
 
• Finding 3: Removing container media from roots of trees, shrubs and perennial plants, straightening 
roots and prune to reshape as needed helps plants establish. What does this mean?  Hose off 
container media until roots are bare. Closely inspect roots, prune off anything that is damaged or 
dead, or pointed the wrong direction including ones that grow in a circle and could not be 
straightened.  
 
How to Prepare a Planting Hole 
1. Dig the hole after you have prepared the roots. This is because the size of the hole is determined by 
the size of the root system. 
2. Make the hole in the shape of a shallow bowl -- same depth as the root system and at least twice its 
width. 
3. Remove roots and large rocks from the hole. 
4. Fill the hole with water and let drain. 
 
How to Plant 
1. Break up the excavated native soil into small pieces. Mound some of the excavated soil in the center 
of the hole to support the roots. Place roots over the mound and spread it outward like rays of a 
 

starfish. You need enough soil so the plant’s crown (where the stem meets the roots) is at or just 
above soil level of the surrounding garden. 
2. Water well and let drain. 
3. Check crown level again and adjust if needed.  
4. Fill the hole and firmly press soil with hands. 
5. Water Again. 
 
How to Work with Clay 
Clay particles are the smallest of three types of soil particles (sand, silt, clay) and tend to bind tightly 
together. Clay soil feels hard when dry, but is easily shaped and molded when moist. 
If you are endowed with clay soil, put it to use. Clay holds more water and nutrients than sand or silt. It 
binds closely with minerals that help plants grow. When clay is broken into smaller pieces, these 
minerals become more available to plants.   
Remember, healthy soil is composed of 25% air, 25% water, 45% minerals, and 5% organic matter. To 
ensure space for air and water, avoid compacting soil by walking on it or working it when it’s too wet. To 
check readiness, squeeze a handful of soil tightly in the palm. If it forms a ball yet falls apart easily, it is 
ready. 
 
Guidelines for Soil Improvements  
The principle for soil improvement is to not amend at all or amend the entire area that supports plant 
roots. For shorter-lived plants where immediate performance is paramount, amend the entire planting 
bed. For long-lived plants such as trees and shrubs, don’t amend. Instead, mulch over the soil surface 
with a layer of organic matter such as arborist’s wood chips or compost. 
 
Before planting annual flowers and vegetables – Amend the planting bed by mixing compost into the full 
depth of plant roots that will be grown in this bed.  Add 4 inches if not amended before, otherwise add 2 
inches.  
Before installing lawns and perennial flower beds – Amend the entire area by mixing 2 to 4 inches of 
compost into the existing soil. Add compost in small batches and mix in with each addition. This 
improvement is only temporary because compost will breakdown over time. 
Before planting trees and shrubs – It’s not practical to amend the soil of the root zone of a mature tree 
or shrub. Instead, use a 4-inch layer of arborist’s wood chips as mulch. Extend the mulch 30 inches or 
greater from the trunk; feather to the trunk to keep it from touching the bark. 
To improve established perennials, shrubs and trees – Apply 1 to 2 inches of compost as mulch on the 
soil surface or use arborist’s wood chips as described above.

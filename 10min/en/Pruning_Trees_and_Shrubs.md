## Pruning Trees and Shrubs  

### Reasons for Pruning  
- To train a plant  
- To maintain plant health  
- To improve the quality of flowers, fruit, foliage, or stems  
- To restrict growth  

### Tools  
- **Hand shears** – Bypass type preferred; anvil type also available; for branches up to ½ inch in diameter.  
- **Lopping shears** – For branches ½ to 2 inches in diameter.  
- **Pole pruners** – For pruning overhead without a ladder.  
- **Hedge shears** – Manual and power types.  
- **Saws** – A variety depending on the need.  

### Types of Pruning Cuts  
- **Heading cuts**  
  Heading cuts remove the tip of a shoot or branch. This increases the number of new branches at the cut end; the shrub or tree becomes bushier when growth resumes.  

  You can encourage conifers to be bushier by removing all or part of the new “candle” in spring before it begins to develop side branches.  

- **Thinning cuts**  
  Thinning cuts remove an undesired branch or twig by cutting at the point of origin, whether at ground level or from the trunk or the parent branch. Thinning cuts result in a more open plant and don’t stimulate excessive new growth.  

### Where to Cut Stems with a Small Diameter  
In general, cut back twigs and small branches to just beyond a vigorous bud, or cut at an intersecting branch.  

When cutting to a bud, choose a bud that is pointing in the direction new growth is desired. Cut close enough to avoid leaving a stub but not too close to damage the bud.  

The arrows in the illustration indicate correct cuts.

### Time to Prune  
In general, prune in late winter before new growth starts.  

For flowering shrubs, prune at a time to minimize disruption of blooming:  
- **Spring flowering shrubs** (Table 1) bloom on last season’s growth; prune them soon after they bloom to promote vigorous summer growth.  
- **Shrubs that bloom after June** (Table 2) do so from buds that are formed on the current year’s shoots; prune these shrubs in late winter to promote vigorous spring shoot growth.

### How to Remove a Large Branch  
When pruning a tree, remove thick, heavy branches flush with the collar at the base of the branch rather than flush with the trunk. *(The collar is a slight bulge at the base of a branch where it connects to the trunk.)* Removing the collar causes serious damage regardless if the pruned branch is living or dead.  

Branches larger than 1½ inch in diameter should be pruned in three steps as shown:  
1. **First cut (A)** – On the underside of the branch, about 12 inches from the trunk; saw about halfway through the branch.  
2. **Second cut (B)** – On the upper side of the branch, about 4 to 6 inches beyond (A); saw until the branch swings down of its own accord.  
3. **Final cut (C)** – Remove the stub from the trunk.

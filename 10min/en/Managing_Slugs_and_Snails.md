## Managing Slugs and Snails  

### Some Basic Facts  
Terrestrial slugs and snails are soft-bodied, land-dwelling mollusks that can live up to six years. As they glide along on a muscular “foot” that secretes mucus, they leave behind a signature slime trail. Adults are active at night and on cloudy or foggy days, seeking hiding places on sunny days.  

Slugs often burrow into the soil, up to six feet deep, for a cool and moist environment. Snails seal themselves off with a parchment-like membrane for protection during hot, dry periods or when it is cold. During cold weather, snails and slugs hibernate in the topsoil. In areas with mild winters, snails and slugs can be active throughout the year.  

Most land slugs and snails are hermaphrodites, with each adult having both male and female reproductive organs. Adult brown garden snails mature in two years and lay an average of 80 spherical, pearly white eggs at a time in underground nests, up to six times a year. Slugs reach maturity in three to six months and lay clear or milky white, oval to round eggs in batches of 3 to 40.  

### Damage  
Both snails and slugs feed on living plants and decaying plant matter, causing damage to leaves, flowers, fruits, and other succulent plant parts. Look for silvery mucus trails to confirm their presence. Their damage typically appears as irregular holes with smooth edges.

## How to Control Slugs and Snails  
A combination of techniques listed below will be most effective at reducing slug and snail populations and minimizing damage to your garden. The best time for long-term control is to treat the whole garden in the autumn. This reduces the number of adult slugs and snails that lay eggs. A second application in late winter or early spring will help keep the adult population down. A third application one month later should prepare your garden for the growing season. Regular monitoring is required, as slugs and snails can re-infest gardens from neighboring properties.

### Remove Damp, Dark Hiding Places  
- **Time irrigation:** Avoid watering your garden in the evening when slugs and snails come out to feast. Water in the morning instead.  
- **Till in the spring:** Minimize leaf debris to prevent feeding baby slugs and snails as they hatch.  
- **Turn over winter mulch:** While mulch benefits plants and soil, it is also a good hiding place. Turn over mulch and other garden debris to expose pests and their eggs to predators.  

### Erect Barriers  
- **Copper strips:** Tests show that slugs may receive an electric shock when crawling over copper if the strip or mesh is wide enough to prevent slugs from raising their bodies over it. However, most copper stripping sold in garden shops is not wide enough to create an effective barrier.  
- **Lime, ashes, diatomaceous earth (in dry form):** These slow slugs down but do not kill them. These barriers need to be replaced after rain or irrigation.  

### Encourage Predators  
Many animals prey on slugs and snails, including:  
- Toads  
- Snakes  
- Beetles  
- Marsh flies  
- Birds  
- Frogs  
- Salamanders  
- Newts  
- Ducks  
- Millipedes  
- Porcupines  
- Raccoons  

Encourage predators that fit with your gardening approach.  

### Set Traps  
- **Homemade traps:** Use a flat board or inverted flower pot with one edge propped up as attractive hiding places. Inverted cabbage leaves or orange/grapefruit rinds also work well. Place traps out in the evening and check them every morning until numbers drop, then check weekly.  
- **Hand pick:** Twice weekly during early spring and fall, search typical hiding places under rocks and foliage. Do this at night (more productive) or during the day. Drop slugs and snails into a bucket of soapy water. Wear gloves or use tweezers. If slime gets on your skin, wash with white vinegar and warm water.  

### Bait  
- **Beer or yeast and honey mixture:** Set a deep trap, like a yogurt container, with the rim at ground level to ensure pests cannot crawl back out. Prepare the honey and yeast mixture by boiling water with honey and yeast; proportions are not critical. Beer may be used as is. Check the container daily to ensure no unintended animals have fallen in. Empty and refill every couple of days.  
- **Iron Phosphate (Sluggo, Escar-Go):** Interferes with calcium metabolism in the gut, causing snails and slugs to stop feeding and die within 3 to 6 days. Iron phosphate is safe to use around pets, humans, fish, birds, beneficial insects, and mammals. It may be used around food crops, ornamentals, lawns, gardens, greenhouses, and berry gardens up to harvest. Iron phosphate remains active for up to 2 weeks, even with repeat wettings.  
- **Metaldehyde (Deadline):** Dehydrates snails and slugs rapidly if ingested. However, if water is nearby or if it rains soon after application, it may not work. Slugs can lose half their body weight and shrink to one-third their size from Metaldehyde or salt but recover if they reach wet soil or if it rains. These products are not recommended for use around edible vegetables and can be harmful to dogs, cats, and fish. Follow the label carefully.

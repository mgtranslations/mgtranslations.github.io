Managing Slugs and Snails 
 
Some Basic Facts 
Terrestrial slugs and snails are soft-bodied, land-dwelling mollusks living up to six years. As they glide along 
on a muscular “foot” which constantly secretes mucus, they leave behind a signature slime trail. Adults are 
active at night and on cloudy or foggy days while seeking hiding places on sunny days.   
 
Slugs often burrow into the soil, up to six feet deep, for the cool and moist environment. Snails seal 
themselves off with a parchment-like membrane for protection during hot, dry periods or when it is cold. 
During cold weather, snails and slugs hibernate in the topsoil. In areas with mild winters, snails and slugs can 
be active throughout the year. 
 
Most land slugs and snails are hermaphrodites with each adult having both male and female reproductive 
organs. Adult brown garden snails mature in two years and begin to lay an average of 80 spherical, pearly 
white eggs at a time in underground nests, up to six times a year. Slugs reach maturity in three to six months 
and lay clear or milky white, oval to round eggs in batches of 3 to 40.  
 
Damage 
Both snails and slugs feed on living plants and decaying plant matter, causing damages to leaves, flowers, 
fruits, and other succulent plant parts. Look for the silvery muceous trails to confirm their presence. Their 
damage normally is shaped like irregular holes with smooth edges.  
 
How to Control Slugs and Snails 
A combination of techniques listed below will be most effective at reducing slug and snail populations and 
minimizing damage to your garden. The best time for long-term control is to treat the whole garden in the 
autumn. This way, there will be fewer adult slugs and snails to lay their eggs. A second application in late 
winter or early spring will keep the adult population down. A third application one month later should keep 
your garden in good shape for the growing season. However, regular monitoring is also required as slugs and 
snails can re-infest gardens from neighboring properties. 
 
• Choose Your Plants with Care 
Resistant Plants:  Agapanthus, Anemone, Astilbe, Bamboo, Bleeding Hearts, Candytuft, Coral Bells, Ferns, 
Foxglove, Hens and chicks, Ivy, Juniper, Nandina, Sedum, Solomon’s Seal, Sweet Woodruff, Wintergreen, 
Yew 
Slugs love to eat: Basil, Broccoli family, Carrots, Lettuce, Potatoes, Strawberries, Campanula, Daffodils, 
Gardenia, Gentian, Hosta, Impatiens, Japanese Painted Fern, Leopard’s bane, Lilies, Lobelia (perennial), 
Marigold, Narcissus, Primrose, Star of Bethlehem, Trillium, Tuberose Begonia, Viola, Wild Ginger.  
 
• Remove Damp, Dark Hiding Places 
Time irrigation – Avoid watering your garden in the evening when slugs and snails come out to feast. Water 
in the morning instead.  
Till in the spring to minimize leaf debris to feed baby slugs and snails as they hatch. 
Turn over winter mulch – While mulch is beneficial to plants and the soil, it is also a good hiding place. Turn 
over mulch and other garden debris to expose these pests and their eggs to predators.  
• Erect Barriers 
 

Copper strips - Tests show that slugs may receive an electric shock when they crawl over copper if the strip 
or mesh is wide enough to prevent slugs from raising their bodies over it. However, the majority of copper 
stripping sold in garden shops for this purpose is not wide enough to create an effective barrier.  
Lime, ashes, diatomaceous earth (in dry form) slow the slugs down, but do not kill them. These barriers also 
need to be replaced after rain or irrigation. 
 
• Encourage Predators 
Many animals prey on slugs and snails, including toads, snakes, beetles, marsh flies, birds, frogs, 
salamanders, newts, ducks, millipedes, porcupines and raccoons. Encourage those that fit with your 
gardening approach. 
 
• Set Traps  
Homemade traps such as a flat board or inverted flower pot with one edge propped up are attractive hiding 
places. Likewise, inverted cabbage leaves, orange/grapefruit rinds also work well. Place them out in the 
evening. Check traps and destroy pests every morning until numbers drop, then check weekly.  
Hand pick – Twice weekly during early spring and fall, look in typical hiding places under rocks and under 
foliage. Do this night (more productive) or day; drop the slugs and snails in a bucket of soapy water. Wear 
gloves or use tweezers. If you get slime on your skin, wash with white vinegar and warm water.  
 
• Bait 
Beer or yeast and honey mixture - Set a deep trap, like a deep yogurt container, with the rim at ground level. 
This ensures pests cannot crawl back out. Prepare the honey and yeast mixture by boiling water with some 
honey and yeast; the proportions are not critical. Beer may be used as is. Check the container daily to make 
sure a frog or something else hasn't accidentally fallen in. Empty and refill every couple of days. 
 
Iron Phosphate (Sluggo, Escar-Go) interferes with calcium metabolism in the gut, causing snails and slugs to 
stop feeding and die 3 to 6 days later. Iron phosphate is safe to use around pets, humans, fish, birds, 
beneficial insects, and mammals.  It may be used around food crops, ornamentals, lawns, gardens, 
greenhouses, and berry gardens up to harvest.  Iron phosphate remains active for up to 2 weeks, even with 
repeat wettings. 
 
Metaldehyde (Deadline) dehydrates the snail or slug rapidly if ingested. However, if there is water nearby or 
if it rains soon after application, it may not work. A slug can lose half its body weight and shrink to one-third 
its size from Metaldehyde or salt and recover, if it can get to wet soil fast enough, or if it rains. These 
products are not recommended for use around edible vegetables, and can be harmful to dogs, cats, and fish. 
Follow the label carefully.

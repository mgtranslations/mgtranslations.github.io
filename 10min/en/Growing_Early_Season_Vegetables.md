Growing Early-Season Vegetables 
 
What 
Early-season vegetables are also called “cool-season” crops. In general, their seeds will germinate at a 
lower soil temperature and will grow in cooler air temperature. Examples include: root vegetables (beet, 
carrot, kohlrabi, potato, leek, onion, and radish), Cole crops (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussel 
sprout) and leafy vegetables (lettuce, parsley, spinach, pea, chive, and kale).  
 
Some cool-season vegetables tend to develop flowering stalks when the air warms up. Look for varieties 
that “resist bolting” or reach maturity in fewer days. Direct sow dill, arugula, cilantro and other plants that 
are prone to bolting.  
 
Planting Season 
Early-season vegetables will germinate and grow at lower temperatures and are usually planted in March 
or April, depending on the weather and your soil condition.   
 
Vegetables that germinate in 40°F soil temperature include: fava bean, beet, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, 
Chinese cabbage, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, kale, collard, kohlrabi, leek, parsley, radish, rutabaga, pea, 
Swiss chard, celery, and turnip; while lettuce, onion, parsnip, and spinach germinate at 35°F. 
 
When to Begin Planting  
Begin planting when soil is not too wet, but is warm enough for the crop you want to plant. Take care not 
to work the soil when it is too wet. To check soil moisture, squeeze a handful of soil in your hand – if water 
drips out, or the soil forms and stays in a tight ball, wait. Working the soil when it is too wet will ruin its 
structure. If you rototill a bed, make one or two passes over workable soil.  Stop when soil still contains 
small chunks; don’t pulverize it. 
 
Soil temperature is important to seed germination, root growth, and activities of soil microbes that convert 
nutrients into a form usable by plants.  The astute gardener checks his/her garden with a soil thermometer 
before sowing and planting. Check the soil temperature at 9 a.m., by inserting the thermometer probe into 
the ground at a depth of 2 inches, for 7 consecutive days. The average gives you a good indication of when 
to sow and plant.   
 
Helpful Tools for Planting Earlier   
*Add 2”-4” organic matter in fall to add nutrients, improve soil tilth and reduce compaction from rain 
*Cover ground with clear polyethylene plastic to warm soil clear also grows weeds very well  
*Make a raised bed, use a cloche, cold frame or plastic tunnel 
*Cover newly planted ground with floating row cover to warm soil and protect planting while allowing light 
and water to penetrate.

Selecting Among Seeds, Transplants, or Perennials 
Carrot, pea, lettuce, kohlrabi, greens, beet, and radish grow easily from seeds; sow seeds directly into the 
soil. Pre-sprout seeds, especially those with thick coating, to speed up germination. One method is to soak 
seeds 2- 4 hours before planting in the ground; or place soaked seeds between two layers of damp paper 
towels then into a plastic bag. Keep them in a warm place until the seeds germinate.   
 
Growing your own transplants ensures getting varieties you want at the correct time to plant. Cabbage, 
broccoli, cauliflower and kale are commonly available as seedling plants from nurseries; buying small plants 
give a head start and speeds up the harvest. This is particularly important if the vegetable is a type that 
tends to “bolt” rather than growing leafy greens when warmer weather arrives.  
 
Some vegetables come neither as seeds nor plants. Examples are potato tubers, garlic and onion bulbs 
(sets) which can be planted directly into garden soil. Growing perennial vegetables is another way to get an 
early start. Consider asparagus, sorrel, Jerusalem artichoke, rhubarb and artichoke, all are perennials that 
do not need to be planted every year and produce early in the season. 
 
Soil Fertility 
Most vegetables are annual crops and need sufficient nutrients to produce well. Plants use only the 
nutrients that are dissolved in soil water, but most nutrients in the soil are not in a soluble form. For 
immediate result, use water-soluble forms of fertilizer.  
 
If you use organic fertilizers that are not in liquid form, apply a couple of months before planting. Examples 
of organic fertilizers are fish emulsion (3-5% N); composted chicken manure (3% N); blood meal (12-15% N); 
bone meal (12-24% P); and kelp meal (2-5% K).   
 
Portland metro area vegetable gardens have shown in a recent study to have consistently and extremely 
high levels of phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients. We recommend gardeners do a soil test to find 
out what is deficient and only fertilize as needed. Heavy feeders such as beet, collard, kale, lettuce, parsley, 
spinach, and tomato may need more nutrients. Light feeders such as carrot, garlic, onion, chard, mustard, 
and pepper may need a moderate amount. Bean, pea, soybean, and clover fix nitrogen from the air and 
often do well with no fertilizer.

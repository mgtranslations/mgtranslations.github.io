## Growing Early-Season Vegetables  

### What  
Early-season vegetables, also called “cool-season” crops, germinate at lower soil temperatures and grow in cooler air temperatures. Examples include:  

- **Root vegetables**: beet, carrot, kohlrabi, potato, leek, onion, radish  
- **Cole crops**: broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussel sprout  
- **Leafy vegetables**: lettuce, parsley, spinach, pea, chive, kale  

Some cool-season vegetables tend to develop flowering stalks when the air warms up. Look for varieties that “resist bolting” or reach maturity in fewer days. Direct sow dill, arugula, cilantro, and other plants prone to bolting.

### Planting Season  
Early-season vegetables germinate and grow at lower temperatures and are usually planted in **March or April**, depending on the weather and soil condition.  

Vegetables that germinate at specific soil temperatures:  

- **40°F soil temperature**: fava bean, beet, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, Chinese cabbage, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, kale, collard, kohlrabi, leek, parsley, radish, rutabaga, pea, Swiss chard, celery, turnip  
- **35°F soil temperature**: lettuce, onion, parsnip, spinach

### When to Begin Planting  
Begin planting when soil is not too wet but is warm enough for the crop you want to plant.  

- **Check soil moisture**: Squeeze a handful of soil in your hand. If water drips out or the soil forms and stays in a tight ball, wait. Working wet soil ruins its structure.  
- **Rototilling**: Make one or two passes over workable soil. Stop when soil still contains small chunks; avoid pulverizing it.  

**Soil temperature** is crucial for seed germination, root growth, and soil microbe activity. Use a soil thermometer to check soil temperature:  

1. Insert the thermometer probe into the ground at a depth of 2 inches.  
2. Check at 9 a.m. for 7 consecutive days.  
3. Calculate the average temperature to determine when to sow and plant.

### Helpful Tools for Planting Earlier  
- Add **2”-4” organic matter** in fall to improve soil nutrients, tilth, and reduce compaction from rain.  
- Cover ground with **clear polyethylene plastic** to warm soil (note: clear plastic also grows weeds well).  
- Use a **raised bed**, cloche, cold frame, or plastic tunnel.  
- Cover newly planted ground with **floating row cover** to warm soil and protect planting while allowing light and water to penetrate.  

See **[How to Build Your Own Raised Bed Cloche (EC 1627)](http://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu)**, an Oregon State University Extension publication, for detailed instructions.

### Selecting Among Seeds, Transplants, or Perennials  

#### Seeds  
Carrot, pea, lettuce, kohlrabi, greens, beet, and radish grow easily from seeds. Sow seeds directly into the soil.  

- **Pre-sprouting seeds**:  
  - Soak seeds for 2-4 hours before planting in the ground.  
  - Alternatively, place soaked seeds between two layers of damp paper towels inside a plastic bag. Keep them in a warm place until seeds germinate.  

#### Transplants  
Growing your own transplants ensures getting the varieties you want at the correct time to plant.  

- Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and kale are commonly available as seedlings from nurseries.  
- Buying small plants gives a head start and speeds up harvest, especially for vegetables prone to “bolting” in warmer weather.  

#### Perennials  
Some vegetables come neither as seeds nor plants, such as potato tubers, garlic, and onion bulbs (sets), which can be planted directly into garden soil.  

Growing perennial vegetables is another way to get an early start. Consider:  
- Asparagus  
- Sorrel  
- Jerusalem artichoke  
- Rhubarb  
- Artichoke  

These perennials do not need to be planted every year and produce early in the season.

### Soil Fertility  
Most vegetables are annual crops and need sufficient nutrients to produce well.  

- Plants use only nutrients dissolved in soil water. For immediate results, use **water-soluble fertilizers**.  
- If using **organic fertilizers** (non-liquid), apply a couple of months before planting. Examples:  
  - Fish emulsion (3-5% N)  
  - Composted chicken manure (3% N)  
  - Blood meal (12-15% N)  
  - Bone meal (12-24% P)  
  - Kelp meal (2-5% K)  

#### Soil Testing  
Portland metro area vegetable gardens have consistently high levels of phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients. Gardeners should perform a soil test to identify deficiencies and fertilize only as needed.  

- **Heavy feeders**: beet, collard, kale, lettuce, parsley, spinach, tomato may need more nutrients.  
- **Light feeders**: carrot, garlic, onion, chard, mustard, pepper may need moderate nutrients.  
- **Nitrogen fixers**: bean, pea, soybean, clover often do well without fertilizer.

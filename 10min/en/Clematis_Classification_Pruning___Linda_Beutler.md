Large variable flowered clematis
 
 
Flowers can be single or semi-double on new wood, semi-double or double on old.  
 
‘Asao’, ‘Louise Rowe’, ‘Mrs Cholmondeley’, ‘Mrs George Jackman’, ‘My Darling’, ‘Pafar’ PATRICIA ANN FRETWELL, ‘Piilu’, ‘Vyvyan Pennell’

‘Diamond Ball’, ‘Duchess of Edinburgh’, ‘Kiri te  Kanawa’, ‘Multi  Blue’

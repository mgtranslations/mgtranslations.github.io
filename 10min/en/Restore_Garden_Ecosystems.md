Restore Natural Ecosystems in Urban Gardens  
Rapid growth of humans in urban areas often leads to development and expansion of transportation 
networks that fragment natural landscapes and ecosystems. This disrupts natural processes and reduces 
the capacity of ecosystems to mitigate the effects of storms, floods, wildfires, heat waves and droughts. 
It also results in loss of habitat for pollinators, bats, birds and amphibians. (Hardy et al. 2022) 
 
In the Portland metropolitan area, public, private, non-profit and tribal entities work together to protect 
natural areas from development and fragmentation. Restoring ecological functions in home gardens, 
school grounds, parks and other community spaces, can enhance the regional effort. By observing nature 
and following ecological principles, gardeners can improve resilience of their own gardens and add 
habitat for wildlife. Working with neighbors, they can extend the impact. 
   
ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES AS RESTORATION GOALS 
Ecology is the study of how living things interact with their environment. By translating ecological 
principles into restoration goals, we can let nature guide our actions to restore ecosystem functions and 
increase resilience of our environments and communities. 
 
• PRINCIPLE: Everything is connected.   
o Physical connections allow movement of wildlife within and across urban areas.  
o GOAL: Reconnect ecosystems and fragmented habitats. 
• PRINCIPLE: Everything goes somewhere. 
o Elements on Earth are finite. Water, carbon and key plant nutrients (N, P, K), circulate 
through Earth’s systems in different forms, supporting life on Earth.  
o GOAL: Restore natural water and nutrient cycles. 
• PRINCIPLE: Nature knows best.  
o Life evolves to fill ecological niches to ensure survival of individual species. The greater the 
diversity of life, the more resilient the system is to disturbances like climate change.  
o GOAL: Strive for diversity.   
 
RESTORE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN GARDNS 
Gardeners can adapt habitat restoration practices to improve the garden ecosystem. It begins with 
observing nature, followed by encouraging diversity and restoring water and nutrient cycles. 
 
Observe and Learn from Nature  
Observe what is thriving in your yard and what is not. Consider how much sun each part of the garden 
receives. Explore plants on surrounding lands. A nearby area that supports native plants is ideal. Identify 
the plants that you would like to see in your garden. Note whether they grow in sun or shade, dry or wet 
conditions. Observe the insects and birds that visit the plants. Aim for diversity; the greater the diversity 
of plants, the greater the diversity of wildlife species that a garden can support. 
 
Restore water and nutrient cycles 
Begin by restoring soil health to improve water holding capacity and nutrient availability for plants.

• Minimize soil disturbance to preserve soil structure and increase diversity and abundance of soil 
organisms, including fungal networks which facilitate plants’ access to nutrients.  
• Minimize tillage and create walking paths that minimize soil compaction. Consider limiting the 
areas for parking or driving.  
• Aim to cover the soil with plants. Add mulch to areas with bare soil or keep some ground 
uncovered for ground-nesting bees. 
• Add mulch on top of soils to speed up the soil regeneration process. Mulches, like arborist wood 
chips and leaves, can increase the volume and diversity of soil organisms which in turn will 
provide more nutrients to support plant growth. Wood chips and leaves also help retain soil 
moisture and reduce weeds.  
• Add woody debris in the form of logs and stick piles that provide habitats for insects and, if 
conditions are right, amphibians. These will eventually be decomposed by soil organisms, 
building soil volume. Use logs to define trails or bed borders. 
• Keep water on the land by retaining organic matter and litter at the surface. Keep large trees with 
extensive roots to help increase water infiltration and to provide shade.  
• Install bioswales and rain gardens and disconnect downspouts where viable.  
• Store rainwater for use in the yard and reuse gray water in the home where possible. 
• To protect water quality, avoid oil and fuel leakage on driveways. Avoid use of chemicals to 
control moss, weeds or pests in outdoor spaces. 
 
Strive for diversity 
Provide homes for a wide variety of wildlife that feed, make homes and find protection in dense native 
plantings.  
• Remove invasive plants that can outcompete beneficial plants. 
• Plant a diversity of plants that are native to your region. 
• Plant five canopy layers (big trees, small trees, large shrubs, small shrubs, ferns and grasses, and 
herbaceous ground covers) leaving a buffer around built structures to reduce fire risk. 
• Select the right size trees. For small lots near houses, consider native hazelnut, red alder, bitter 
cherry, Cascara, western flowering dogwood or madrone. Select trees to match the soil, water 
and light conditions of the landscape. 
• Cover the soil with dense plantings, grouping plants with like water, nutrient, and light needs.  
• Select plants that provide continuous bloom throughout the seasons.  
• Interplant with crops to make an edible landscape. 
• Replace lawns with hedgerows, pollinator meadows, ground covers or an eco-lawn that includes 
a mix of slow growing grasses and forbs.

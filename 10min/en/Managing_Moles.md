Managing Moles  
Introduction 
Moles are insectivores, eating earthworms, grubs, beetles, and insect larvae. Occasionally they 
may sample bulbs, root crops, and sprouting seeds, but there is disagreement among scientists 
on this point.  
 
Moles live in moist, fertile, highly organic soil. They spend most of their time in underground 
runways, causing low ridges to form. Mole runways form a vast interconnecting network.  The 
telltale “mole hill” is a round and symmetrical pile of dirt pushed up to the surface where moles 
actively excavate.  The number of mounds may not be an indication of how many moles are in 
the area.  A single mole actively invading a new area may build 3 to 4 new mounds daily, and it 
can produce 30 to 60 mounds in one month. Moles are also quite territorial and defend their 
territory from other moles. So you probably have a lot fewer moles than you think. 
 
Moles cause damage by undermining plants with their tunnels. This creates problems keeping 
plant roots moist, especially in a vegetable garden. Mole tunnels also create access points for 
voles (also known as meadow mice) which eat most of the plant material for which the moles 
get blamed. Finally, many homeowners find the mounds very unsightly, especially in lawns. 
Tunnels may persist in clay soils for a number of years but when they collapse, the lawn area 
can become very uneven. 
 
Moles require large quantities of food and may travel up to half a mile a day to find food. Their 
mobile habit makes controlling them difficult. 
 
Some Considerations before Acting 
• How certain are you of moles being the nuisance animal?  
• How much damage may occur without any control? 
• What are the benefits of control? What is the cost of damage? 
• How might your action affect other animals? Humans? 
 
Options for Control 
• Extermination is challenging and takes time; removing moles from your garden does not 
keep the neighbor’s moles from moving in.  If you are desperate for results, consider setting 
traps. Many other options exist but none offers consistent results. Beware of many 
products that claim to “repel” – none has been proven to work. If you choose to use 
chemicals, be sure to follow instructions on the label because the label is the law.  
 
 

• Exclusion: It is possible to attach wire mesh under wooden-sided raised beds to prevent 
moles from getting into the beds. Use one-quarter inch galvanized mesh and secure it well 
to the bottom of the bed frame. 
 
• If you choose traps, take time to locate an active tunnel. Locate active tunnels by stomping 
down mole hills in the day. Check the next morning for new hills, which indicate active 
tunnels immediately under.  Probe 6-18 inches from the center of the mole hill for tunnels; 
a long screwdriver or steel rod will suffice. If the probe suddenly drops a couple of inches, 
you have found a tunnel.  Probe again to map out the runway.  Controlling Moles offers 
useful details and is free online. Once you locate the runway, cut out a section of soil down 
to the floor of the tunnel. Take care to match the width of your section with the width of 
the trap. Place the trap by following manufacturer’s instructions. Cover the trap location 
with a bucket and heavy concrete block to avoid accidental injury. 
The average mole has a territory of ¼ acre. If the trap does not show result in a few days, 
move it to another active location. 
 
• Moles are sensitive to concussion. Smacking a shovel on the ground near a working mole 
may stun or kill it.  You have to have a lot of patience and good hand-eye coordination. 
 
• Fumigation with lethal gases is rarely successful with moles.  
 
• Poison bait formulations are currently available. Newer baits delivered in an earthworm 
shaped carrier may be the most effective but no bait has been consistently effective. Be 
sure to read and follow all poison bait label instructions very carefully. Moles can push baits 
from the tunnel out onto the surface. Always cover the bait location with a bucket and 
heavy block and plug the tunnel opening with a rock if possible. Baits pushed to the surface 
can injure other animals, pets, or children.  
 
• Some techniques that rarely work include flooding runways, poking sharp object down 
runways, planting “mole plants”, using “sonic” repellers, or baiting with gum.

Soil 101 
 
What is Soil? 
Physical and chemical weathering breaks rock down into smaller mineral particles, which make up 45 
percent of healthy soil. Adding 5 percent organic matter and filling the space between particles with 
air and water create the ideal soil. Soil is home to countless microorganisms, invertebrates and plant 
roots. Soil organisms are nature’s recyclers, turning dead cells and tissue into nutrients, energy, 
carbon dioxide and water. Soil provides physical support for plants as well as air for plant roots.   
 
Soil Texture 
Soil texture describes how coarse or fine a soil is. The coarsest soil particles are sand, visible to the 
eye and give soil a gritty feel. Silt particles are smaller than sand (about the size of individual particles 
of white flour). They give soil a smooth, floury feel. Clay particles are the smallest and can only be 
seen with a microscope. They typically have a flat shape. Soils rich in clay feel very hard when dry, but 
are easily shaped and molded when moist. 
 
Soil Structure 
Individual particles of sand, silt and clay tend to cluster and bind together, forming aggregates which 
provide structure to a soil. Aggregation is a natural process caused largely by biological activities such 
as earthworm burrowing, root growth and microbial action. Soil structure is fragile and can be 
damaged or destroyed by compaction, excessive tillage, or tillage when the soil is too wet. Loss of 
organic matter also weakens soil structure.   
 
Organic Matter 
When organic matter (OM) decomposes, it forms humus. Humus acts as a natural glue to bind and 
strengthen soil aggregates. Adding OM is the best way to improve all soils. OM helps build and 
stabilize structure in fine-textured and compacted soils, thus improving permeability, aeration and 
reduce the risk of runoff and erosion. OM also helps sandy soils hold water and nutrients. 
 
Soil Organisms 
Soil abounds with life. Besides the plant roots, earthworms, insects and other creatures you can see, 
soil is home to an abundant and diverse population of microorganisms. In a mere ¼ teaspoon of soil 
can live as many as a billion microorganisms. Their main function is to break down the remains of 
what was once living. This process creates soil organic matter while releasing energy, nutrients, and 
carbon dioxide. Because organic matter forms the foundation of the soil food web, soils with more 
organic matter tend to have more organisms. 
 
Microorganisms are most abundant in the rhizosphere – the thin layer of soil surrounding plant roots.  
Their activity depends on soil moisture, temperature and the organic matter content.  
Microorganisms are most active between 70° and 100°F, while earthworms are most active and 
abundant at about 50°F. Most organisms prefer moist soil.  
 
 
 

 
Soil Nutrients and Fertilizers 
Clay soil is a rich reservoir of 13 essential plant nutrients: primary nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, 
potassium), secondary nutrients (sulfur, calcium, magnesium) and micronutrients (zinc, iron, copper, 
manganese, boron, molybdenum, chlorine). When clay soil is broken up into small pieces and mixed 
with organic matter, nutrients become more accessible. Soil nutrients are usable only when dissolved 
in soil water.  
 
Annual flowers, vegetables, and fruiting shrubs and trees need added fertilizer. Consider using a 
balanced formulation that contains all primary nutrients. For immediate results, consider using 
water-soluble forms of fertilizer. If you use organic fertilizers that are not in liquid form, apply a 
couple of months before planting so that microorganisms have time to break them down. 
 
Soil Tests 
Soil tests give information on the levels of nutrients in your soil and recommend how much fertilizer 
to add based on the test results and the crops you grow. Testing your soil once every three to five 
years is sufficient.  
 
Soil Amendments 
A soil amendment is any material thoroughly mixed into a soil to improve its physical properties, such 
as water retention, permeability, water infiltration, drainage, aeration and structure.  Good organic 
amendments for garden soils should have been composted before use. They include sawdust, 
manure, grass or wheat straw and yard waste compost. Inorganic amendments include pumice, 
perlite, vermiculite and sand. 
 
Amending the soil is not the same thing as mulching, although many types of mulch also are used as 
amendments. A mulch is left on the soil surface. Its purpose is to reduce evaporation and runoff, 
moderate soil temperature, inhibit weed growth, and create an attractive appearance.  
 
Tilling 
Tilling can turn under organic matter, control weeds, break crusted soil for water penetration, or 
loosen a small amount of soil for planting. Frequent tilling, however, tends to destroy soil structure. 
Never till soil when it is wet. Doing so will leave you with cloddy, compacted soil. To test soil 
moisture, take a handful of soil and squeeze it. If it stays in a mud ball, it is too wet to till. If it is 
powdery and clumped, it is too dry. If it crumbles freely, it is just right.

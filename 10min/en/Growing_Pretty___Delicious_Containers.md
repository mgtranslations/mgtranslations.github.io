Growing Pretty and Delicious Containers 
Overview 
 Ceramic pots, window boxes and other ves-
sels brimming with leafy greens, edible flowers, 
herbs or vegetables are ideal for homes big and 
small. Containers with beautiful edible plants offer 
an alternative to conventional residential landscapes 
and space limitations.  
 Edible landscaping is the use of food-pro-
ducing plants in the residential landscape; in this 
case, plants grown in containers. A variety of con-
tainers can lift plants to heights where they can be 
appreciated both to the eye and the palate. Enjoy the 
freshness and flavor of home-grown fully ripened 
fruits, salads, herbs and vegetables.  
 
Location  
Most fruits and vegetables require 6-8 hours 
of sun to produce well. Some native plants and edi-
ble leaves, like lettuce and kale, can tolerate some 
shade. Where you place your containers is im-
portant. Make some observations in your yard to 
better understand the best sun exposure morning, 
noon and afternoon. If the container lands in a 
handy place, those fresh herbs will more likely 
make their way into your diet.  
 
Containers  
When selecting containers, think about how 
and where you will group them. What will be the 
common element of design that marries the aesthet-
ics you are seeking? Factors such as container color, 
texture, material, shape and practicality need careful 
consideration. Don’t be afraid to repurpose objects 
such an old wheelbarrow, watering can or even 
those leaky boots. No matter what container you 
choose, it must have good drainage holes! NEVER 
use wood containers treated with toxic preservatives 
such as creosote.  
 
Space 
  As a guideline, a pot 12 inches across would 
be the minimum size for small flowering plants and 
leafy greens. Always consider the mature size of the 
plant. Plant spacing information on the plant la-
bels or in seed catalogs are valuable resources.  
    
Growing Media 
  Containers should be filled with potting mix 
or planter mix and not garden soil. Due to the in-
tensive gardening practice, it is recommended you 
add a 3 to 4 month slow-release fertilizer into the 
potting mix.   
   
Time and Care 
       Vegetable gardens, even in containers, re-
quire love and attention. That translates into pest 
control, weeding and watering. Apply Integrated 
Pest Management and use pesticides only as a last 
resort. The benefit of the container is easier weed-
ing and access. Plants require careful watering. 
Poke your finger up to your second knuckle into 
the soil (2-3 inches). If it feels damp and cool, don’t 
water. Daily watering might be warranted in the 
heat of the summer. Be consistent. Weekly trim-
ming, dead-heading and thinning out plants will 
contribute to productive harvests. As plants in the 
container grow, be willing to remove those that 
don’t work, and then add replacements to keep the 
container looking good.  Succession planting of 
greens can be done by adding 3-5 seeds weekly. Fi-
nally, the application of a water-soluble fertilizer 
every 2-3 weeks will feed the plants. All this effort 
is why they taste so good! 
 
Beauty 
 When planting a pot of deliciousness, con-
sider what you like to eat first! The design will 
come from plant size, flower color, foliage shape, 
leaf patterns and a variation of textures. Consider 
plants with varying heights and vibrant vegetable 
color. It’s important to mass flowers for impact. 
Give vegetables room and offer vertical support for 
plants that climb or spread as they grow. Do a little 
bit of research to discover plants with the charac-
teristics you value.  
 
 

 
 
Design  
 Thriller, Filler and Spiller Design Framework: 
   
Thriller: the largest and most striking plant in the con-
tainer, usually placed in the middle (if the pot will be 
viewed from all sides) or in the back of a pot (if 
viewed from just one side). The Thriller lends a strong 
vertical element to the container. This could be a pep-
per plant, teepee of climbing beans, blueberry bush or 
tomato plant. For smaller containers a tall growing 
Russian Kale works.  
 
Filler : a shorter plant with a different texture and/or 
pattern. This will disguise a woody stem and bulk up 
the container with exquisiteness. Plant them all around 
the center thriller or in a semi-circle for the back 
thriller. Bright Swiss Chards, Oak Leaf Lettuce or 
bushy herbs like parsley, sage or cilantro can be 
picked as needed by the stem for fresh produce.   
 
Spiller: a plant that trails or will overflow in a down-
ward motion on the outside of the container. Having a 
contrasting texture, color of foliage/flower or develop-
ing vegetable will increase interest in the container. 
They are planted at the edge of the pot and adjacent to 
the fillers. Lemon Cucumbers or summer squash will 
wander and offer attractive sunny globes.  A combina-
tion of trailing herbs such as rosemary and thyme will 
cascade to draw the eye downward in the design and 
offer plenty of flavors, fresh or dried.  
 
Safety 
 Growing your own plants from seed gives you 
quality seedlings and greater choices. Not all flowers 
are edible. In fact, some plants create toxins to dis-
courage animal or insect damage. Those same toxins 
are harmful to humans. When eating “new” plants, 
start with small amounts to determine if you have any 
food sensitivities. In most cases, the petals are the tast-
iest part of the flower.                                         
 
Plant Selection 
 Check the plant label for water, sun and spac-
ing requirements. In a “combination container” those 
requirements should be similar for best success and 
ease of care. Adding flowers to the container will at-
tract and feed pollinators.  
 Most of the plants listed here will progress in 
their life cycle; producing leaves, flowers and then 
seeds. These have been sorted by their most popu-
lar edible state.

Mustard Greens, Swiss Chard

## Gardening with Children Ages 11-14  

Gardening with children aged 11 to 14 can be exciting and rewarding for both children and adults. It pulls them away from computer and other screen time, sparks imagination, and reduces stress and anxiety. Children of this age are physically ready to do more extensive garden work and will enjoy exploring structures in the garden, such as building a trellis or a raised garden bed. These activities save space, provide better sunlight and soil, and are very empowering for children.

Children in this age group can plan, anticipate cause and effect, and observe and predict outcomes. Gardening builds skills for learning, planning, problem-solving, and responsibility—lifelong skills needed in all aspects of life. Learning about the interdependence of plants and animals is particularly interesting to this age group. Understanding how insects, amphibians, plants, and other garden animals like moles, voles, and gophers interact is key to successful gardening. Decreasing the use of pesticides and herbicides that disrupt natural processes, and learning how soil, water, and compost contribute to a fertile garden, are essential lessons.

## Some Activities  

### Build a Raised Vegetable Bed  
Planning and designing a bed to produce vegetables is a great way for children to understand the necessity of adequate sunlight, a water source, and the soil profile needed to grow vegetables. They will also need to plan what will be planted for the best use of space and coordinate the timing of the plantings.

### Build a Rain Garden  
This activity can be simple or complex but offers a wonderful opportunity for children to learn the importance of clean water and how to contribute to a clean environment.  

- Read books that describe how plants hold soil structure, slow down water, retain nutrients, and filter pollutants.  
- Research plants that grow and thrive in wetlands or seasonally wet spaces. What plants are beneficial species for a rain garden?

### Build an Amphibian Habitat  
This project can be done in a rain garden or, if you have adequate space, you can create a small pond in a shaded, wet area of an existing garden. Encouraging amphibian activity is beneficial to the garden because amphibians are predators of many insects that can damage ornamental plants and vegetables.  

A variety of frog and salamander species are native to Oregon. They require shade, holes, crevices, or covered spaces depending on the species. Materials such as bark pieces, old pots, sticks, assorted rocks, moss, and other natural items can be used.

### Support Biodiversity  
Build habitat boxes for a variety of local species. Explore the importance of hummingbirds, migrating birds, bats, and mason bees in the garden space.  

Children can build well-constructed, usable habitat boxes to increase habitat opportunities for local species. Resources such as “All About Birdhouses” by NestWatch (Cornell Lab of Ornithology) may be helpful. There is also abundant information online or at your local library about birdhouses for specific species, as well as bat house design and placement.  

If children are interested in mason bees, the OSU Extension publication [Nurturing Mason Bees in Western Oregon](https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/em9130) will be helpful. These habitat explorations can lead to thoughts about plants that attract pollinators.

## Add Literacy  
There are many wonderful picture and instructional books about gardening that children will appreciate before they begin and while they are working in the garden. Reading aloud to them invites questioning and can be a springboard for garden plans. Your local librarian can help you find resources that both you and your child will enjoy.

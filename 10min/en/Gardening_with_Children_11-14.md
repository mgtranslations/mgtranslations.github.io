Gardening with Children Ages 11-14 
Gardening with children 11 to 14 can be exciting and rewarding for both children and adults. It pulls 
them away from computer and other screen time and sparks imagination which in turn reduces stress 
and anxiety. Children of this age are physically ready to do more extensive garden work and will enjoy 
exploring structures in the garden such as building a trellis or a raised garden bed that will save space 
or provide better sunlight and soil. These activities are very empowering for children. 
 
11 to 14-year-old children can plan, anticipate cause and effect, and observe and predict outcomes. 
Gardening builds skills for learning, planning, problem-solving and responsibility. These are lifelong 
skills that are needed in all aspects of a child’s life. Learning about the interdependence of plants and 
animals is of interest to this age group. How insects, amphibians, plants and other garden animals like 
moles, voles and gophers interact with each other is important for successful gardening. Decreasing 
the use of pesticides and herbicides that disrupt natural processes is key and learning how soil, water 
and compost contribute to a fertile garden needs to be observed to have clear understanding.   
 
Some Activities 
Build A Raised Vegetable Bed 
Planning and designing a bed to produce vegetables is a great way for children to understand the 
necessity of adequate sunlight, a water source, and soil profile needed to grow vegetables. They will 
also need to plan what will be planted for the best use of space and coordinate the timing of the 
plantings.

Build a Rain Garden  
This activity can be simple or complex but is such a wonderful opportunity for children to learn the 
importance of clean water and how to contribute to a clean environment. There are so many 
resources available online to help you decide the kind of rain garden best suited for your yard.  
Read books that describe how plants hold soil structure, slow down water, retain nutrients, and filter 
pollutants. Do research on what kind of plants grow and thrive in wetlands or seasonally wet spaces. 
What plants are beneficial species for a rain garden? The public library and their staff can help you 
locate titles that best address your research.  Some suggested resources are:   
PDF article on Rain Gardens in Oregon https://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/sgpubs/oregon-rain-garden-
guide 
City of Portland guidelines for rain gardens https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/article/188636 
 
Build an Amphibian Habitat   
This project can be done in a rain garden or, if you have adequate space, you can create a small pond 
in a shaded, wet area of an existing garden. Encouraging amphibian activity is beneficial to the garden 
because they are predators of many insects that can damage ornamental plants and vegetables. A 
 

 
 
variety of frog and salamander species are native to Oregon. They require shade, holes, crevices, or 
covered spaces depending on the species. Bark pieces, old pots, sticks, assorted rocks, moss, and 
natural materials are possible materials for the project. Some suggested resources are:

Support Biodiversity  
Build habitat boxes for a variety of local species. What is the importance of hummingbirds, migrating 
birds, and bats in the garden space? What about mason bees?   
Children can build well-constructed, usable habitat boxes and increase habitat opportunities for local 
species. “All About Birdhouses” NestWatch, Cornell Lab of Ornithology may be helpful in your 
research but there is an abundance of information on birdhouses for specific species as well as bat 
house design and placement online or at your local library. If the children are interested in mason 
bees, OSU Extension publication, Nurturing Mason Bees in Western Oregon  
https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/em9130 will be helpful. These habitat explorations can lead to 
thoughts of plants that attract pollinators. The following link will guide you in planting species that 
attract birds and insects to the garden:

Add Literacy  
There are many wonderful picture and instructional books about gardening that children appreciate 
before they begin and while they are working in the garden. Reading aloud to them invites 
questioning and can be a springboard for garden plans.  Your local librarian will be happy to help you 
find some resources that both you and your child will enjoy.

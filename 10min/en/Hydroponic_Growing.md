Low-Tech Hydroponic Gardening Indoors
Hydroponics is growing plants, without soil, in a water-based nutrient solution. Large-scale
hydroponic systems employ sophisticated technology to monitor the level of nutrients, pH,
dissolved oxygen, temperature of the nutrient solution, and the amount of light the plants are
receiving. This handout introduces a low-tech option that is suitable for home gardeners.
 
The Kratky Method of Hydroponics – A Suitable Choice for Home Gardeners
Bernard A. Kratky, a University of Hawaii horticulturist, discovered that plants suspended over a
nutrient solution could grow air-absorbing roots as the nutrient solution was used up. The Kratky
Method negates the need for pumps and compressed air. Benefits of the Kratky Method include:
- Environmentally friendly – it uses very little water and needs no pumps or compressors to
  circulate water
- Inexpensive to start – it requires simple, easily accessible components
- Easy to operate – nutrients are incorporated into the water to begin the project; this setup
  lasts the duration of the growing period until harvest
- Quick result – growing in nutrient-rich solution under indoor lights produces harvestable
  products quickly
- Lower pest and disease pressure in indoor environment – take care to avoid bringing insects
  such as aphids, spider mites, and fungus gnats indoors.
 
 
Supply List & Tips for System Setup
- Container to hold water/nutrient solution: Any sturdy container with dark sides will work.
  Examples include concrete mixing tubs (9 gallons), plastic totes and buckets (5-gallons), and
  even mason jars wrapped in dark paper. Select the size to suit the number of vegetables you
  plan to grow. Allow about 1.5 gallons per plant and make sure there is sufficient space for
  plant roots.
- Lid for the container: It serves three functions -- 1. Minimizes evaporation, 2. Provides support
  for net cups, and 3. Excludes light. Net cups suspend from the lid for plant roots to grow in the

nutrient solution. The lid may come with the container or can be made from foam board or
other materials.
• Net cups are porous and hold the planting medium which surrounds seeds or transplants.
Roots grow through the net cups into the nutrient solution. Common cup size is 2 inches.
• Planting medium provides an anchor for seeds or transplants. Organic options include coco
coir, perlite, peat moss, or a potting mix. Inorganic clay balls and mineral wool can also work.
You can plant seeds directly into the net cups filled with planting medium or you can start
seeds in advance and move the small plants into the net cup.
• Hydroponic nutrients come in liquid form or dry form. Dry form is easy to use and costs less to
ship. MaxiGro and Master Blend are two dry mix examples. It takes about 2.5 tablespoons of
MaxiGro to make 5 gallons of nutrient solution (500-600 ppm).
• Water for making the nutrient solution should have a nearly neutral pH. Check your water
supply. Well water may need the pH adjusted.
• Light is suspended, to raise and lower as needed, in response to plant growth. Consider a
pulley system – it may come with your grow lights. One 300–600 W equivalent LED light priced
between $35-60 will cover about a 3’ x 3’ area. Check the specifications of a grow light: they
are labeled as blue, red, or white/balanced light. Blue light or mixed light bulbs are suitable for
starting seeds and leafy green. Red light or mixed light bulbs are suitable for promoting bud
formation in flowering plants as well as keeping the plants shorter. White lights or
mixed/balanced light bulbs are suitable for most plants at any stage of growth. Use a timer to
provide light 12 to 14 hours on and 12 to 10 hours off.
 
How to Begin Growing Hydroponically
1. Set up the entire system.
2. Mix the nutrient solution. In the case of dry nutrients, take care to ensure they are dissolved.
3. Fill the container to a depth so that the bottom ¼” of the net cup is immersed in the solution.
4. Add planting medium to the net cup and insert seeds (thin to one after germination) or
transplant.
5. Set the light level and timer.
6. Monitor plant performance and adjust the light as plants grow.
7. Harvest leafy greens such as lettuce, Swiss chard, spinach, and basil by removing outer leaves
as they grow to extend harvest season instead of cutting the entire plant when it is mature.
8. After harvest, take apart the container, lid, and net cup. Dump remaining nutrient solution in
the garden. Clean components before the next use.

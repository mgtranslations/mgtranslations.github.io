## Adding a Rain Garden  

A rain garden is a sunken bed that collects and treats stormwater runoff from rooftops, driveways, sidewalks, and streets. Rain gardens mimic natural forest or meadow conditions and keep our watersheds healthy.  

### Benefits of Rain Gardens  
- Reduce flooding by absorbing rainwater.  
- Filter oil, grease, and toxic materials to reduce stream and river pollution.  
- Help recharge groundwater aquifers.  
- Provide beneficial habitat.  
- Restore the natural water cycle in the landscape.

### Steps to Add a Rain Garden  

#### 1. Begin with a Map  
- Make a map of your property.  
- Indicate the flow of water after a rainfall.  
- Mark structures, slopes, low spots, and where water might drain into a neighbor’s yard or onto public property.  

#### 2. Decide Which Impervious Surfaces to Treat  
- Measure these surfaces to determine the square footage of the area to be treated.  
- The size of a rain garden needs to be at least **10% of the area of the impervious surface draining into it**.  

#### 3. Site Your Rain Garden  
- Place the rain garden close to its source of water (e.g., a gutter or downspout).  
- Locate it so water flows in at a higher spot than where it will exit.  
- Note areas where overflow can be absorbed or safely directed into an approved stormwater collection point, like a storm drain.  

**Avoid siting a rain garden in areas that:**  
- Stay wet throughout the season, indicating poorly draining soil.  
- Are within three feet of a sidewalk.  
- Are within two feet of a retaining wall or building.  
- Are on a slope steeper than 10%.  
- Are on top of a septic system drain field or less than 50 feet away from a drain field.  
- Are in soil contaminated by chemicals.  

> **Note:** Some cities and counties have specific regulations regarding disconnecting downspouts and routing or piping water. Verify requirements with local authorities.  

#### 4. Assess Your Soil  
- The soil should absorb water within 24 to 48 hours.  
- Test infiltration rate by digging a hole to the planned depth of the rain garden and filling it with water.  
  - Record the time it takes to drain completely.  
  - Repeat three times.  
- Soil that drains **½ inch or more per hour** is suitable. Otherwise, it needs modification.  

You can have your soil tested by a company and get recommendations on how to improve porosity. Refer to [Analytical Laboratories Serving Oregon](https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/em8677.pdf).  

#### 5. Design the Rain Garden  
- Rain gardens should be a minimum of **five feet wide** and **8 to 28 inches deep**.  
- Side slopes need to be **18 inches of horizontal length to 6 inches of vertical height**.  
  - For example, if the rain garden is 12 inches deep, you will need 36 inches of slope.  
- The bottom of the rain garden should be level.  
- Berms should be at least **2 inches above the elevation of the outlet**.  
- The rain garden should drain within **24 to 30 hours**.  

**Overflow Planning:**  
- The overflow point should be **2 inches below the top of the berm** on the downhill side.  
- Insert a pipe in the berm at least two inches below the rim to direct water to:  
  - A flat area of landscape.  
  - Another rain garden.  
  - A French drain.  
  - A drainage ditch.  
  - A storm drain.  

**Additional Tips:**  
- Use large rocks and gravel at inflow and outflow areas to slow water and prevent erosion.  
- Plant selection depends on location:  
  - The inflow area retains the most moisture and suits plants that like “wet feet.”  
  - The sides or berms will be drier.  
- Use tough plants (e.g., sedges or bunch grasses) around inflow and outflow points to slow water.  
- Use ground covers to prevent erosion on the sides of the berms.  

#### 6. Construct the Rain Garden  
- **Call Before You Dig:** It is the law in Oregon to call the Utility Notification Center before excavating. Call **1-800-332-2344** or **811** two days before you plan to dig.  
- Excavate and build when the soil is dry enough to work with easily.  
- Ideally, plant vegetation in the fall.  
- Mark the boundaries with a garden hose, string, stakes, or marking paint.  
- Place excavated soil (spoils) to the outside edge and away from the inflow point.  
- Use spoils to form the berms that border the rain garden.  

#### 7. Care for and Maintain the Rain Garden  
- Ensure new plants get sufficient water during the dry summer season.  
  - Water deeply and slowly as needed during the first year.  
  - Soaker hoses are useful for this purpose.  
- Mulch the slopes and edges with an even **2- to 3-inch layer of bark dust** to suppress weeds and retain moisture.  
  - Compost can also be used but does not suppress weeds as well. It adds fertility to the soil and helps filter pollutants.  
- Weed and prune plants appropriately.  
- Replenish the mulch layer as needed.  
- Remove undesirable soil brought by erosion to maintain exposed rocks and prevent further erosion.

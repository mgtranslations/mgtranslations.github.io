Creating A Pollinator Garden 
The key to creating a successful pollinator garden is to provide pollinating insects and other critters 
with a place to raise their young and ensure that they have a reliable food source from spring to late 
autumn. Common pollinators in gardens include bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, birds, 
and even ants. Because there is such a variety of pollinators with many different requirements, the 
best strategy is to grow many different types of flowering plants that produce nectar and pollen.  
With that goal in mind, here are the steps to creating a space that is beautiful and welcoming to 
pollinating insects. 
1. Size and location  
Six to eight hours of sunlight is ideal. You can introduce pollinator plants into an existing bed or 
make a new bed.  
 
2. Soil   
Assess your soil. Is it sandy and well-drained or more clay-like and wet? The type of soil will 
determine which plants will thrive, depending on their requirement for good drainage and fertility. 
Have your soil tested if you are unsure of your soil type. Soil pH should be between 6.0 and 7.0. 
 
3. Irrigation  
Watering is important, especially during plant establishment, which can take 1 to 3 years. 
Determine how you will provide water to your plants. Use soaker hoses or other watering 
methods to direct water to the root zone. 
 
4. Plant Selection 
• Seek a diversity of flower shapes, sizes and colors. 
• Ensure continuous flowering from early spring to late autumn. 
• Use native plants, including shrubs and trees, which provide early and abundant flowers.  
• Use non-natives that offer pollen and nectar. 
• Plant single-flowered varieties which offer easily accessible pollen and nectar, compared to 
double flowers.  
• Place pollinator flowers in larger blocks to keep foraging energy efficient.  
Consult recommendations from the Oregon State University Garden Ecology Lab for candidates 
when it comes to attracting native bees. Native Plant Picks for Bees is an Oregon State University 
publication that offers many suggestions. https://extension.oregonstate.edu/catalog/pub/em-

5. Size Considerations 
Start small and increase the size of your garden over time, whether you are making a new bed or 
adding containers. Observe frequently and watch to see what pollinators are attracted to your 
plants. Are there bees, butterflies, hummingbirds or birds? 
 

 
6. Flowering Duration 
The goal is to design a garden that has blooms from early spring until late autumn. Use annuals 
and bulbs, such as California poppy, Oregon iris and camas, to supplement shrubs and perennials 
and increase plant diversity. If you have space, many native trees and shrubs, such as Manzanita 
and California lilac, bloom early in the growing season and offer abundant floral resources.  
 
7. Maintenance  
The garden benefits from regular weeding and watering. Lightly mulch to reduce weeds. Leave 
areas of bare soil to provide habitat for native nesting bees.   
 
8. Pesticides 
Protect pollinators by using an Integrated Pest Management approach to controlling pests and 
diseases in your garden. Choose resistant plants to minimize occurrence of pests and diseases, 
prune off infected parts and use other cultural and biological controls for problems. Use chemicals 
only as a last resort.  
 
9. Fall Cleanup 
Keep non-diseased leaves, plant stems and seedheads in the garden until late spring, to support 
overwintering of pollinator larvae, eggs, pupae and adults.

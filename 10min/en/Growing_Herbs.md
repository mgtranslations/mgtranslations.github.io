Growing Herbs 
Overview 
 An herb is a plant that, unlike a tree, does not 
produce a woody stem. It will live long enough to 
develop flowers and, often, seeds. Herbs can be 
annuals, biennials, or perennials. Depending on who’s 
counting, there are 40 to 70 different kinds of herbs.  
Attributes 
Herbs are categorized in two or more ways: 
• Aromatic  
 Most herbs have pleasant smelling flowers or 
foliage and are grown for their oils to produce 
perfumes, toilet water, and various scents.  Examples: 
lavender, mint, marjoram, lovage, rosemary, and basil. 
• Culinary  
These herbs are prized for adding flavor to cooking.  
Among these herbs, parsley is produced in the 
highest quantity and used mostly as a garnish.  
Next in popularity is sage.  More examples include 
basil, chives, dill, thyme, savory, marjoram, mint 
and rosemary. 
• Medicinal  
 Used in medicine since ancient times, some herbs 
are believed to have the power to cure a wide range of 
ailments or to ward off evil spirits. Others, such as 
garlic, may have preventive characteristics. 
 While present medical knowledge recognizes 
some herbs as having healing properties, others are 
highly overrated and should be used carefully, if at all, 
because they can interact with medications, whether 
prescription or over-the-counter items.  
 Before using herbs for medicinal purposes, consult 
with your health care professional. 
• Ornamental  
 Grown for fresh or dried arrangements, these 
herbs may have brightly colored flowers and foliage 
while others have variegated foliage.  A few examples 
are thyme, rosemary, mint, lavender, and chives. 
Longevity   
 Annual herbs grow and bloom one season and 
then die.  Examples: anise, basil, chervil, coriander, 
dill, and summer savory.         
 Biennial herbs live for two seasons and will bloom 
during  the second season.  Examples: caraway and 
parsley. 
 Perennial herbs can live for a number of years and 
will bloom each season.   Some are deciduous (die 
down for the winter) whereas others are evergreen. 
Examples of deciduous perennial herbs are chives, 
fennel, and winter savory whereas evergreen perennial 
herbs include marjoram, rosemary, and thyme. 
Growing herbs outdoors 
How to start 
 Nearly all herbs can be grown from seed.  The 
guideline for planting seeds is sow them at a depth 
equal to 2 to 4 times their width.  In other words, the 
finer the seed, the more shallow it should be sown.   
 Sow anise, coriander, dill and fennel directly into 
the garden because they do not transplant well.  
 Cuttings and divisions are useful, even easier than 
sowing seeds, when you propagate tarragon, chive, 
and mint.  In fact, true French tarragon can only be 
started from a cutting or a division of an existing plant. 
Soil 
 Most herbs grow best in well-drained, fairly fertile 
soil with a neutral pH of 6.5 to pH 7.0.  Drainage is 
probably the single most important factor in successful 
herb gardening.  Herbs stall, and may die, in soggy 
soil.   
Fertilizer  
 The soil does not have to be especially fertile, so 
use little or no fertilizer.  With herbs, highly fertile soil 
tends to produce excessive amounts of foliage with 
little flavor.   
 Among the exceptions are chervil, fennel, lovage 
and summer savory, all of which require moderate 
amounts of fertilizer.  Compost is ideal. 
Location  
 In general, herbs need full sun but will thrive on as 
little as 6 hours of sunlight per day.  A few herbs, such 
as mint, need to be contained or they will overtake a 
garden.   
 Plant any potential runaways in containers, or plant 
in a container which you sink into the ground to just 
below the rim.  Use a pot large enough to confine the 
roots for a couple of years. 
Growing herbs indoors 
 For the most part, herbs require lots of sunlight.  
This is why growing herbs indoors during the winter 
requires supplemental lighting.  It’s important to realize 
that the intensity of winter light is often less than one-
tenth of the outdoor light during summer.  Then too, the 
 

window glass further decreases the amount of light 
that’s available for indoor plants of any kind. 
 Unless light is plentiful, growth of most indoor 
herbs will slow or stop during the winter even when 
kept in a warm location.  
 Perennial herbs will benefit if you place them 
outdoors during the summer in a protected location or 
plunge the pot in soil up to its rim. 
Watering indoor herbs   
 Water thoroughly only when the soil surface is dry 
to the touch.  Don’t  allow potted herbs to sit in a 
saucer of water; their roots will die. 
Fertilizing indoor herbs  
 Indoor herbs will require weekly applications of 
liquid fertilizer or organic fish emulsion whenever the 
plants are actively growing. 
Insects and other pests 
 Very few insects, mites or diseases attack herbs. 
 In fact, a number of herbs are said to repel pests 
and some gardeners believe that herbs make terrific 
companion plants.  Some herbs, such as garlic, are 
even used in organic pest management formulas. 
 Aphids, a common soft-bodied pest in any garden, 
may feed on anise, caraway, dill, curled leaf parsley, 
and fennel.  Sometimes the first clue of their presence 
is the stickiness on the leaves and stems. 
 Other potential, but less common, pests include 
whiteflies, mealybugs, scale, thrips and slugs.  And in 
hot dry weather, spider mites may be troublesome.  
 Most of the small, soft-bodied critters can be easily 
and safely managed with regular use of harsh water 
sprays or insecticidal soap, diluted according to label 
directions, both applied directly to the pests.  Whatever 
the treatment, be certain the label states its is safe to 
use on edibles. 
 Disease, other than root problems due to 
excessively wet soil or potting mix, is uncommon in the 
herb family.  Sometimes mint is infected by rust; if so, 
remove the affected stem and associated leaves.   
Harvesting and storing 
 During the season, you may pick fresh leaves as 
soon as the plant has enough foliage to maintain 
growth.  In general, herbs have the best flavor if 
gathered before the flower buds open.   
 Harvest herbs in the morning, when the essential 
oils that give herbs their signature aromas and flavors 
are at their highest concentration.  Pick leaves after 
dew has dried, but before the sun becomes too hot. 
 For major harvests, annual herbs may be cut off at 
ground level, while perennials should only be cut down 
about one-third of their size. 
 You can preserve many herbs for future use by 
drying or freezing them.  To do the latter, place 
chopped fresh herbs in an ice cube tray, cover with 
water, and freeze. Basil is basically devoid of flavor if 
dried, so use it fresh or freeze it one of two ways – as 
pesto, or in an ice cube tray as chopped leaves 
covered with water.

# Growing Herbs

## Overview

An herb is a plant that, unlike a tree, does not produce a woody stem. It will live long enough to develop flowers and, often, seeds. Herbs can be annuals, biennials, or perennials. Depending on who’s counting, there are 40 to 70 different kinds of herbs.

## Attributes

Herbs are categorized in two or more ways:

- **Aromatic**  
  Most herbs have pleasant-smelling flowers or foliage and are grown for their oils to produce perfumes, toilet water, and various scents. Examples: lavender, mint, marjoram, lovage, rosemary, and basil.

- **Culinary**  
  These herbs are prized for adding flavor to cooking. Among these herbs, parsley is produced in the highest quantity and used mostly as a garnish. Next in popularity is sage. More examples include basil, chives, dill, thyme, savory, marjoram, mint, and rosemary.

- **Medicinal**  
  Used in medicine since ancient times, some herbs are believed to have the power to cure a wide range of ailments or to ward off evil spirits. Others, such as garlic, may have preventive characteristics.  
  While present medical knowledge recognizes some herbs as having healing properties, others are highly overrated and should be used carefully, if at all, because they can interact with medications, whether prescription or over-the-counter items.  
  Before using herbs for medicinal purposes, consult with your health care professional.

- **Ornamental**  
  Grown for fresh or dried arrangements, these herbs may have brightly colored flowers and foliage while others have variegated foliage. Examples include thyme, rosemary, mint, lavender, and chives.

## Longevity

- **Annual Herbs**  
  Grow and bloom one season and then die. Examples: anise, basil, chervil, coriander, dill, and summer savory.

- **Biennial Herbs**  
  Live for two seasons and will bloom during the second season. Examples: caraway and parsley.

- **Perennial Herbs**  
  Can live for a number of years and will bloom each season. Some are deciduous (die down for the winter) whereas others are evergreen. Examples of deciduous perennial herbs are chives, fennel, and winter savory, whereas evergreen perennial herbs include marjoram, rosemary, and thyme.

# Growing Herbs Outdoors

## How to Start

Nearly all herbs can be grown from seed. The guideline for planting seeds is to sow them at a depth equal to 2 to 4 times their width. In other words, the finer the seed, the more shallow it should be sown.

- Sow anise, coriander, dill, and fennel directly into the garden because they do not transplant well.
- Cuttings and divisions are useful, even easier than sowing seeds, when you propagate tarragon, chive, and mint. True French tarragon can only be started from a cutting or a division of an existing plant.

## Soil

Most herbs grow best in well-drained, fairly fertile soil with a neutral pH of 6.5 to 7.0. Drainage is probably the single most important factor in successful herb gardening. Herbs stall, and may die, in soggy soil.

## Fertilizer

The soil does not have to be especially fertile, so use little or no fertilizer. Highly fertile soil tends to produce excessive amounts of foliage with little flavor.

- Exceptions include chervil, fennel, lovage, and summer savory, which require moderate amounts of fertilizer. Compost is ideal.

## Location

In general, herbs need full sun but will thrive on as little as 6 hours of sunlight per day.

- Some herbs, such as mint, need to be contained or they will overtake a garden. Plant potential runaways in containers or sink a container into the ground to just below the rim. Use a pot large enough to confine the roots for a couple of years.

# Growing Herbs Indoors

## Light

For the most part, herbs require lots of sunlight. Growing herbs indoors during the winter requires supplemental lighting.

- The intensity of winter light is often less than one-tenth of the outdoor light during summer. Window glass further decreases the amount of light available for indoor plants.
- Unless light is plentiful, growth of most indoor herbs will slow or stop during the winter even when kept in a warm location.

Perennial herbs will benefit if you place them outdoors during the summer in a protected location or plunge the pot in soil up to its rim.

## Watering Indoor Herbs

Water thoroughly only when the soil surface is dry to the touch. Do not allow potted herbs to sit in a saucer of water; their roots will die.

## Fertilizing Indoor Herbs

Indoor herbs will require weekly applications of liquid fertilizer or organic fish emulsion whenever the plants are actively growing.

# Insects and Other Pests

Very few insects, mites, or diseases attack herbs.

- Some herbs are said to repel pests, and some gardeners believe herbs make terrific companion plants. Herbs such as garlic are even used in organic pest management formulas.
- Aphids may feed on anise, caraway, dill, curled leaf parsley, and fennel. The first clue of their presence may be stickiness on the leaves and stems.
- Other potential pests include whiteflies, mealybugs, scale, thrips, slugs, and spider mites in hot, dry weather.

Most small, soft-bodied pests can be managed with regular use of harsh water sprays or insecticidal soap diluted according to label directions. Ensure the label states it is safe to use on edibles.

Disease is uncommon in herbs, except for root problems due to excessively wet soil or potting mix. Mint may occasionally be infected by rust; if so, remove the affected stem and associated leaves.

# Harvesting and Storing

- During the season, pick fresh leaves as soon as the plant has enough foliage to maintain growth. Herbs have the best flavor if gathered before the flower buds open.
- Harvest herbs in the morning, when essential oils are at their highest concentration. Pick leaves after dew has dried but before the sun becomes too hot.

For major harvests:

- Annual herbs may be cut off at ground level.
- Perennials should only be cut down about one-third of their size.

You can preserve many herbs for future use by drying or freezing them. To freeze:

- Place chopped fresh herbs in an ice cube tray, cover with water, and freeze.
- Basil is best used fresh or frozen as pesto or chopped leaves in ice cubes.

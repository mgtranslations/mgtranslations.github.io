Hanging Baskets 
Overview 
 Hanging baskets, overflowing with abundant richly-
colored flowers, are valued summer-time features in 
many cities and gardens.   
Choose a container   
 A suitable container is large enough to last through 
the entire growing season as well as light-weight 
enough to hoist into place.  A plain container works 
well because, within a short time, the pot will be 
completely covered by your trailing plants.   
 Containers come in a variety of shapes, sizes and 
materials.  Wood, sphagnum moss, and unglazed clay 
or terra cotta, can dry out quickly.  These can be lined 
(usually with a perforated plastic) to keep them moist 
longer.  Realize that clay and terra cotta will be very 
heavy after they are planted and watered.  Select 
containers that fit your style, décor, and landscape. 
 Realize that a 10-inch container may need to be 
watered every 1 to 2 days.  Smaller containers will 
require even more frequent watering.   
Use a potting mix   
 Use a good quality potting mix to fill your container.  
These products are formulated to be very coarse, 
thereby ensuring good drainage in containers.  A well-
drained mix goes a long way toward promoting healthy 
plants.   
 If you re-use the container in another season, 
consider replacing the potting mix.  Replacement 
would be critical to success if the previous planting had 
a root disease; if so, also wash the container well.  
 Don’t use garden soil in containers because its fine 
texture severely limits drainage and, thus, inhibits root 
growth.  Garden soil may also bring in disease, insects, 
and weed seeds. 
 Be aware that the oft-suggested “coarse stuff in the 
bottom of the container for drainage” is wrong.   
Because of the dynamics of water movement within a 
container, that coarse material will inhibit drainage. 
Use fertilizer  
 Get your plants off to a running start by mixing 
fertilizer into the potting mix before planting.  A slow-
release formula designed to persist for 3 to 4 months 
works well because it will last for the entire season.  
After all the plants are in place, settle the potting mix 
around their root balls with water enriched with half-
strength soluble fertilizer. 
Choose your plants  
 It is essential that the plants in an individual 
container do well under the same growing conditions, 
be that sun or shade, moist or relatively dry.   Also 
keep in mind the growth habit of the plants, such as 
upright or trailing.  You can combine annuals and 
perennials in an individual pot for just a single season 
then, at the end of the season, you can replace the 
annuals for a fresh, new look. 
Design and plant  
 After you select a planter, and have the plants and 
potting mix at hand, follow these steps for success: 
1. Pour out the amount of potting mix you think you’ll 
need, then mix in a 3- to 4-month slow-release formula 
fertilizer; follow label instructions for the amount to use. 
2. Pour just enough potting mix into your container so 
that the plants can be set in place and still be 1 inch 
below the rim of your container.  (Be aware that if you 
completely fill the container, you’ll have to repeatedly 
dig out potting mix to make room for the next root ball.) 
3. Set the tall upright plants in the center or back of the 
container, fill in with clumpers next, then finish with 
trailing plants toward the container’s edge.  To create a 
balanced look, place two or more of the same plant (or 
several plants of similar size, foliage, and color) 
opposite each other in the container.  
4. To complete the planting, fill in around the plants 
with extra potting mix to meld the combination and to 
cover any exposed roots.  When everything is in place, 
the potting mix should be about 1 inch below the rim of 
the planter to allow space for watering. 
5. Settle the potting mix around the root balls with 
fertilizer-enriched water mixed at half-strength. 
6. Hang your container where the sun or shade 
conditions match your plants’ requirements.  Now you 
can sit back, relax and enjoy! 
Maintain your container 
 Water when needed.  You won’t need to water as 
often during cool or mild weather as you will when it’s 
warm, even hot, and/or breezy.  During hot weather, 
you may need to water once or twice a day depending 
 

 
upon the size of the container and the number and kind 
of plants in it.   
 When in doubt about the need for water, feel the 
surface of the potting mix.  Water if it is dry, don’t if it is 
moist.   
 The initial dose of fertilizer you mixed into the 
potting mix may be adequate to carry the plants 
through the season.  But if the plants start to lag, 
supplement with a water-soluble fertilizer once or twice 
a week, then repeat as needed.   
 And to keep everything looking tidy through the 
season, deadhead (remove faded flowers) at least 
once a week.

Introduction to Growing Root Crops 
Root crops have a place in every vegetable garden. They are among the first and last vegetables to be 
harvested and with proper home storage, you’ll have a fresh supply into winter. These crops are also 
ideal because they take up little space in the garden, can be harvested over a long period of time and 
produce hefty amounts of energy-rich food. They thrive in raised bed, in-ground and container 
gardens. Gardening histories mention root crops being grown by the early civilizations of 
Mediterranean Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and South America. Just knowing that beets, carrots, 
turnips, potatoes, sweetpotatoes, onions and parsnips have been popular for more than 5,000 years, 
tells us something about them; root crops have survived because they're easy to grow and delicious 
to eat. 
 
"Root vegetable" is a kitchen category, not a botanical one. Botany distinguishes true roots such 
as taproots and tuberous roots from non-roots or geophytes such as bulbs, corms, rhizomes, 
and tubers.  
 
Types of Root Crops 
1. Bulbs store energy for the plant in fleshy layers, above or below the surface. Examples: 
onions, garlic, leeks, shallots  
2. Corms are starchy, underground plant stems that preserve water, energy, and nutrients, to 
enable the plant to reproduce and survive. Examples: taro, water chestnut   
3. Rhizomes are a main plant stem that grows horizontally underground or across the surface of 
the soil. They have nodes that produce shoots. Examples: ginger, asparagus  
4. Tap roots store energy for the plant in sturdy orbs or cylindrical roots. Examples: beets, 
carrots, daikon radish, parsnips, radish, rutabaga, turnips  
5. Tuberous roots are modified, enlarged roots that store food for plants. They are typically 
clustered together at the bottom of a stem with one growing point on the proximal end. 
Examples: sweetpotato, cassava 
6. Tubers are thick, underground stems without a tunic or basal plate and contain many nodes 
or "eyes" that sprout buds on the tuber's surface. Examples: Jerusalem artichoke, yam, 
potato, jicama 
 
Growing Root Crops  
Garden Bed Requirements for Root Crops  
Root crops grow best in an open, sunny location with sandy loam and peat soils. The addition of 
organic matter can improve heavy clay soils. When soil is workable, loosen the top 7-8 inches of soil 
and incorporate compost, coconut core or commercial raised bed soil. A light, loose soil that will 
retain moisture is ideal for growing root crops. The optimum pH of soil varies from 6 to 8, dependent 
 

on type of root crop. Before planting, broadcast one pound of a pre-plant fertilizer (such as 20-20-20) 
for each 100 square feet or aged animal manures and compost for good growth of all of these crops.   
 
Root Crop Pests  
Insect pests include root maggots on turnip, rutabaga and radish; leafminers on beets; and carrot rust 
flies or leafhoppers on carrots and parsnips. Aphids, flea beetles and white flies are common on the 
underside of foliage. Slugs and snails can ravage seedlings and young plants. Protect with barriers or 
baits. Regular monitoring, row covers, traps, and physical removal, are remedies for the home 
gardener. Preventive measures of companion planting can help deter insects. Mammal pests may 
include rabbits, rodents, deer or squirrels munching greens and digging in soil, while gophers and 
rabbits predate the roots. Preventive measures of wire mesh buried deep below the garden bed up to 
the surface and a fine fence/cage perimeter can deter pesky mammals.  
 
Crop Rotation of Root Crops  
The understanding of plant families and crop rotation is essential for plant health and production. The 
annual practice of planting vegetables successively in the different garden locations will avoid the 
build-up of soil-borne pests and diseases and make better use of soil nutrients. This yearly movement 
of crops and rotation on a four-year cycle, will help to prevent problems, fortify soil, and promote 
good root crop production. The practice of crop rotation and companion planting increases natural 
biodiversity in the garden. Companion planting is a great way to use space efficiently. Plants can grow 
in mutually beneficial arrangements. 
Chenopodiaceae – beets, spinach, chard; Companions: bush beans, lettuce, onion, radish 
Brassicas - radish, turnip, rutabaga, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprout, kale, kohlrabi; 
Companions: green onions 
Umbellifers - carrots, parsnips, (celery, fennel, cumin, parsley, cilantro, dill; Companions: beets, 
spinach, onions, chives  
Solanaceae – potato, tomato, bell peppers, chili pepper, eggplant; Companions: sweetpotato, 
horseradish, garlic, peas, thyme 
Alliums – garlic, leek, onion, shallots, scallion, chives; Companions: beets, carrot, lettuce, tomatoes, 
Convolvulaceae – sweetpotato  Companions: parsnips, beets, bush beans, thyme, oregano

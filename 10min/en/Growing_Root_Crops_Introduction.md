## Introduction to Growing Root Crops  

Root crops have a place in every vegetable garden. They are among the first and last vegetables to be harvested, and with proper home storage, you’ll have a fresh supply into winter. These crops are ideal because they take up little space in the garden, can be harvested over a long period of time, and produce hefty amounts of energy-rich food. They thrive in raised beds, in-ground, and container gardens.  

Gardening histories mention root crops being grown by the early civilizations of Mediterranean Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and South America. Just knowing that beets, carrots, turnips, potatoes, sweetpotatoes, onions, and parsnips have been popular for more than 5,000 years tells us something about them: root crops have survived because they're easy to grow and delicious to eat.  

"Root vegetable" is a kitchen category, not a botanical one. Botany distinguishes true roots such as taproots and tuberous roots from non-roots or geophytes such as bulbs, corms, rhizomes, and tubers.

## Types of Root Crops  

1. **Bulbs**  
   Store energy for the plant in fleshy layers, above or below the surface.  
   - Examples: onions, garlic, leeks, shallots  

2. **Corms**  
   Starchy, underground plant stems that preserve water, energy, and nutrients to enable the plant to reproduce and survive.  
   - Examples: taro, water chestnut  

3. **Rhizomes**  
   A main plant stem that grows horizontally underground or across the surface of the soil. They have nodes that produce shoots.  
   - Examples: ginger, asparagus  

4. **Tap Roots**  
   Store energy for the plant in sturdy orbs or cylindrical roots.  
   - Examples: beets, carrots, daikon radish, parsnips, radish, rutabaga, turnips  

5. **Tuberous Roots**  
   Modified, enlarged roots that store food for plants. Typically clustered together at the bottom of a stem with one growing point on the proximal end.  
   - Examples: sweetpotato, cassava  

6. **Tubers**  
   Thick, underground stems without a tunic or basal plate, containing many nodes or "eyes" that sprout buds on the tuber's surface.  
   - Examples: Jerusalem artichoke, yam, potato, jicama

## Growing Root Crops  

### Garden Bed Requirements for Root Crops  

Root crops grow best in an open, sunny location with sandy loam and peat soils. The addition of organic matter can improve heavy clay soils. When soil is workable, loosen the top 7–8 inches of soil and incorporate compost, coconut coir, or commercial raised bed soil. A light, loose soil that will retain moisture is ideal for growing root crops.  

The optimum pH of soil varies from 6 to 8, depending on the type of root crop. Before planting, broadcast one pound of a pre-plant fertilizer (such as 20-20-20) for each 100 square feet or use aged animal manures and compost for good growth of all these crops.

### Root Crop Pests  

Insect pests include:  
- **Root maggots** on turnip, rutabaga, and radish  
- **Leafminers** on beets  
- **Carrot rust flies** or **leafhoppers** on carrots and parsnips  

Other common pests:  
- **Aphids**, **flea beetles**, and **white flies** on the underside of foliage  
- **Slugs** and **snails** ravaging seedlings and young plants  

**Preventive measures:**  
- Protect with barriers or baits  
- Regular monitoring, row covers, traps, and physical removal  
- Companion planting to deter insects  

**Mammal pests:**  
- Rabbits, rodents, deer, or squirrels munching greens and digging in soil  
- Gophers and rabbits predating the roots  

**Preventive measures:**  
- Wire mesh buried deep below the garden bed up to the surface  
- Fine fence/cage perimeter to deter mammals

### Crop Rotation of Root Crops  

Understanding plant families and crop rotation is essential for plant health and production. The annual practice of planting vegetables successively in different garden locations avoids the build-up of soil-borne pests and diseases and makes better use of soil nutrients.  

A four-year crop rotation cycle helps prevent problems, fortify soil, and promote good root crop production. Crop rotation and companion planting increase natural biodiversity in the garden. Companion planting is a great way to use space efficiently, allowing plants to grow in mutually beneficial arrangements.  

#### Plant Families and Companions  

- **Chenopodiaceae**: Beets, spinach, chard  
  - Companions: Bush beans, lettuce, onion, radish  

- **Brassicas**: Radish, turnip, rutabaga, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprout, kale, kohlrabi  
  - Companions: Green onions  

- **Umbellifers**: Carrots, parsnips, celery, fennel, cumin, parsley, cilantro, dill  
  - Companions: Beets, spinach, onions, chives  

- **Solanaceae**: Potato, tomato, bell peppers, chili pepper, eggplant  
  - Companions: Sweetpotato, horseradish, garlic, peas, thyme  

- **Alliums**: Garlic, leek, onion, shallots, scallion, chives  
  - Companions: Beets, carrot, lettuce, tomatoes  

- **Convolvulaceae**: Sweetpotato  
  - Companions: Parsnips, beets, bush beans, thyme, oregano

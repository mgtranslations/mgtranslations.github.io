## Watering Tips

### Theory & Techniques

- **Water early in the morning** when the air is cool, wind is low, and water pressure is higher on municipal systems.
- **Deep watering** throughout the root zone encourages deep rooting and sturdy, healthy plants.
- **Watering depths:**
  - Lawns: 8–10 inches deep
  - Flower beds: 12–15 inches deep
  - Trees: Most absorbing roots are in the upper 12–18 inches of soil, but sinker roots can grow 3–4 feet deep.
  - Shrubs: Roots can grow several feet deep if soil conditions are suitable. Exceptions include camellia and rhododendron roots, which are closer to the surface.
- Use an **application rate** that permits water to soak in rather than run off.
- Concentrate watering in the **root zone** to reduce weed growth.
- **Soil types:**
  - Clay soils absorb water slowly and may need several on-off cycles to moisten thoroughly. Once hydrated, clay soil dries out slowly and requires less frequent watering.
  - Sandy soils allow water to run through quickly but dry out rapidly.
  - Loamy soils fall somewhere in between.
- **Measure water depth and soil dryness** regularly. Let the soil dry out partially between watering to allow oxygen to re-enter the soil.
- **Container plants** dry out quicker than garden beds and need watering more often.
- In vegetable gardens, space plants and rows close enough that canopies barely touch when full-grown. This creates a densely planted area that uses less water and reduces evaporation.
- Conserve soil moisture with a **3-inch layer of organic mulch** such as wood chips or compost.
- **Plastic mulch:**
  - Black plastic reduces evaporation and heats the soil.
  - Red plastic improves yields for tomatoes and peppers.
  - Warm soil is essential for growing vegetables in Oregon’s climate.
- For newly planted trees and shrubs, form a **catch basin** by creating a low soil berm at the outer edge of the root ball. Fill the basin with water and let it soak in. Adjust the number of fills based on soil type:
  - Sandy soil: Fill once.
  - Loamy soil: Fill twice.
  - Clay soil: Fill three times.
- **Salt buildup** in containers: Whitish deposits from hard water and fertilizer may indicate insufficient drainage or inadequate water flow-through. Minimize salt buildup by watering until excess runs out of the drain hole.

### Ineffective Watering


- Yellow or mottled leaves
- Leaves turn pale green or yellow and then fall off
- Plants grow poorly, and spindly stems flop


- Yellow or mottled leaves
- Leaves look dull, somewhat grayed, and lack a reflective quality
- Lawns lose their luster, take on a blue-green cast, and don’t spring back when walked on
- Leaves wilt and don’t recover when watered

When plants wilt on a hot day, check the soil first. If the soil feels moist, wait until evening to see if plants recover; if not, water them.

### Watering Method

Whatever watering method you prefer, check soil moisture several hours after irrigating to determine effectiveness. The goal is to moisten the entire root zone:

- Flowers and vegetables: 12–15 inches deep


- Overhead watering of trees and shrubs (sprinkler or hand) can promote fungal and bacterial problems like apple scab, rust, and black spot on roses.
- Water early enough in the day so leaves dry before evening.


- Hand-watering can deliver water faster than soils can absorb, causing runoff.


- Sprinklers may scatter water where it isn’t needed and often deliver water faster than it can soak into the soil.
- Use sprinklers that cover the garden only, not surrounding areas.
- Minimize evaporation loss by watering during cool, wind-free times (evening through morning).


- **Advantages:**
  - Deliver moisture directly to the root zone at a uniform rate throughout the season.
  - Promote optimal growth and limit diseases by keeping leaves dry.
  - Use up to 50% less water compared to conventional methods.
- **Components:**
  - Timer (mechanical or battery-run)
  - Backflow preventer
  - Pressure regulator
  - Filter
  - Tubing adapter
  - Supply tubing
  - End cap
  - Pressure-compensated emitters for adequate water delivery to each root system
- **Installation Tips:**
  - Lay supply lines on the soil surface.
  - Start with a kit to build confidence, then expand with additional components.
  - Experiment to determine placement, duration, and frequency:
    - Turn on water for an hour, stop for an hour, then check soil moisture depth and width.
    - Adjust placement and duration until the root zone is adequately moistened.

Watering Tips
 
Theory & Techniques 
• Water early in the morning when the air is cool, 
wind is low, and water pressure is higher on 
municipal systems.  
• Deep watering throughout the root zone 
encourages deep rooting and sturdy, healthy plants. 
• Water lawns to 8 or 10 inches deep, flower beds 
to a depth of about 12 to 15 inches.  Most trees in 
Oregon have the majority of their absorbing roots in 
the upper 12 to 18” of soil, but deep growing sinker 
roots can go to about 3 to 4’ deep.  Roots of many 
shrubs can go several feet deep if soil conditions are 
suitable; camellia and rhododendron roots are 
exceptions in that they’re closer to the surface. 
• Use an application rate that permits water to 
soak in rather than run off from the area. 
• Concentrate watering in the root zone. The less 
water applied between plants the fewer weeds grow.                                                                                                                                                                                         
• Clay soils are slow to absorb water and may need 
several on-off cycles to thoroughly moisten.  Once 
hydrated, clay soil is sow to dry out, so can be 
watered less often. Sandy soils allow water to run 
through quickly but will dry out rather rapidly.  Loamy 
soils are somewhere in between. 
• Measuring water depth and soil dryness on a 
regular basis.  Let the soil dry out partially between 
watering to allow oxygen to re-enter the soil.   
• Container media dries out quicker than garden 
beds, so container plants need watering more often. 
In the vegetable garden, space plants and rows close 
enough that the canopies will barely touch when the 
plants are full-grown.  This results in a densely 
planted area which uses less water for more 
abundant harvests.  An added benefit is that shaded 
soil loses less water to evaporation.   
• Conserve soil moisture with a 3” layer of organic 
mulch such as wood chips or compost. 
• Using black plastic mulch reduces evaporation in 
vegetable beds and heats the soil.  With tomatoes 
and peppers, red plastic has the added benefit of 
improving yields.  Warm soil is a key ingredient to 
successfully grow vegetables in our climate. 
• To effectively water newly planted trees and 
shrubs, form a catch basin by making a low soil berm 
at the outer edge of the root ball.  Fill the basin with 
water, then let it soak in.  Each time you water, fill 
the basin once for sandy soil, twice for loamy soil, 
and three times for clay soil. 
• With containers, whitish deposits composed of 
various salts from hard water and fertilizer may build 
up on the surface of the potting mix or on the 
exterior of clay pots, indicating insufficient drainage 
or not enough flow-through of water.  To minimize 
salt buildup, water until excess run out the drain 
hole. 
Ineffective Watering 
Symptoms of over-watering 
• Yellow or mottled leaves.                                                                                  
• Leaves turn pale green or yellow and then fall off. 
• Plants grow poorly, and spindly stems flop.   
Symptoms of under-watering 
• Yellow or mottled leaves.  
• Leaves look dull, somewhat grayed, and lack a 
reflective quality. 
• The lawn loses its luster, takes on a blue-green 
cast, and doesn’t spring back when you walk on it. 
• Leaves wilt and don’t recover when watered.   
 
When plants wilt on a hot day, check soil first. If the 
soil feels moist, wait until evening to see whether 
plants recover; if not, water them.  
Watering Method 
Whatever watering methods you prefer, check the 
moisture of the soil several hours after you irrigate to 
determine how effective your efforts were.  Your goal 
is to moisten the entire root zone of your plants. In 
general, that’s to a depth of 12 to 15 inches for the 
majority of flowers and vegetables. 
 Overhead watering of trees and shrubs, whether 
by sprinkler or by hand, may provide an ideal 
 

environment for the spread of fungal and bacterial 
problems such as apple scab, rust, and black spot on 
roses.  Whenever possible, water early enough in the 
day so that the leaves will dry before evening.  
 Hand-watering is a comforting practice for many 
gardeners. But it can deliver water faster than soils 
are able to absorb it, thereby causing wasteful runoff.   
 Sprinklers can scatter water where it isn’t needed.  
And, as with hand-watering, water is often delivered 
faster than it can soak into the soil. 
 Use a sprinkler that will cover the garden only, 
not the surrounding area.  A sprinkler leads to greater 
evaporation loss than other methods of watering. 
Minimize water loss by watering during the cool, 
wind-free times of day (evening through morning).   
 Low-flow systems (soaker hoses and drip) can 
deliver moisture directly to the root zone at a 
uniform rate throughout the season, promoting the 
best possible growth.  You can combine drip emitters, 
soaker tubing, and miniature sprayers and sprinklers 
for an effective and efficient watering system.   
 A properly functioning low-flow system avoids 
water wasted via runoff or evaporation.  And because 
water is applied directly to the soil, leaves remain dry 
and diseases are limited.  Low-flow systems, 
compared to conventional methods of watering 
(hand or sprinklers), can use up to 50% less water.  
Such systems can also waste water whenever allowed 
to run too long. 
 Low-flow systems are easy to install, as supply 
lines can be laid on the soil surface.  
 Some people prefer to begin with a kit to build 
their confidence, and expand their system by 
purchasing additional component parts. You can 
often obtain free, informative manufacturers’ 
instruction booklets at retail outlets or on-line. 
 A drip system, in its simplest form, begins at an 
outdoor spigot, then adds these components in this 
sequence: timer (mechanical or battery-run); 
backflow preventer; pressure regulator; filter; tubing 
adapter; supply tubing; and an end cap.  Add 
pressure-compensated emitters where needed in 
order to supply plants with adequate water for each 
root system.  Avoid overwhelming the pressure 
regulator by turning on the faucet only part way.  
 You may need to fiddle a bit to find the correct 
layout for your garden. But it will be easy to modify 
during setup and, even during later years, as the 
plants grow or when you change your plantings.  
 After installation, you’ll need to do an easy 
experiment to obtain the answers for several critical 
questions: how far apart to place the drippers or 
soakers; how long to run the system; and how often.  
 Start by turning on the water for an hour, stop for 
at least an hour, then dig in the soil to see how wide 
and deep the moisture penetrated.  If the water isn’t 
deep enough for the root zones of the intended 
plants, move the dripper or soaker to a new place on 
the soil, then turn on the water for longer than the 
first time, wait an hour or so, and check the soil 
again.  Repeat until you have the answers you need.

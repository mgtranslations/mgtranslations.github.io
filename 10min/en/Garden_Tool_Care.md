Care and Maintenance of Garden Tools 
 
Tools deteriorate from time and dampness combined with soil and rust. Proper cleaning and care 
described below will keep them in good working condition and extend their life.  
 
Storage 
Store tools in a clean, dry place. Tools can be stored on shelves or in racks, or simply leaned up 
against a wall. Do not store tools that have wooden parts with the wood in contact with soil or 
concrete. Clean thoroughly and restore handle finishes before storing over the winter. 
 
Care during the Gardening Season 
For shovels, hoes, forks and other long-handled metal tools, keep a 5-gallon bucket 4/5 full of sand, 
with (optionally) about a quart of car engine oil thoroughly mixed into it. After each day’s use 
plunge the tool into the bucket a few times to help clean the blade and coat it with oil. Remove and 
wipe with a lightly oiled rag. 
 
Winter Storage 
Give tools a good cleaning before storing them for the winter. Scrape off soil, using a stiff wire 
brush if necessary. Remove rust with sandpaper. After cleaning, give metal surfaces a protective 
coating such as WD-40 or clean lightweight motor oil. 
 
Step-by-step Instructions for Thorough Cleaning  
Keep tools clean and sharp – well-maintained tools make work easier and more enjoyable. After 
every use, clean off any dirt or rust. Clean the entire tool including blades, handle(s), etc.  
1. Use a brush to clean off any dirt, then a dry rag.  
2. If necessary, follow up with a damp rag, then dry the tool. 
3. If there is a heavy buildup of sap, scrape with a paint scraper or sharp chisel while taking care 
not the gouge the metal. Clean with alcohol, mineral spirits (paint thinner) or household 
foaming bathroom cleaner. Follow up with fine steel wool. 
4. If rust remains, clean away with a wire brush and/or sandpaper. 
5. When the blade is clean, wipe all metal surfaces with a lightly oiled rag. 
6. Wooden parts should have any rough spots or slivers cleaned up by trimming off and sanding 
smooth. Maintain a coating of linseed or mineral oil. 
 
Step-by-step Instructions for Adjusting the Blades 
For two-bladed cutting tools, sometimes the blades are sharp but the tool won’t cut. If your 
pruners are sharp but the object cut is not smooth, tears or leaves a little heel, your pruner is out of 
alignment. Examine the tool for loose parts. Close the handles and look for space between the 
blades. If the blades are misaligned, loose, or bent, the tool must be disassembled for adjustments. 
1. Secure the tool well, with the pivot point exposed, and both the head of the bolt and the nut 
accessible. A good bench vise will help, but a stout table with clamps will do. It is important that 
the tool is securely held, as force will be exerted from varying angles during disassembly and 
reassembly, and if the tool moves severe injury can result. 
2. You may need to free-up rusted bolts first. Apply WD-40, Liquid Wrench, or another penetrating 
 

liquid, following label instructions. 
3. Using wrenches, screwdrivers, or other appropriate tools, remove the pivot bolt. Be certain to 
note the location and alignment of any washers or spacers. Some may be cupped to place 
pressure on other parts of the assembly, so make note of the direction of the cupping for later 
reassembly. In some cases there is a lock nut or other device to keep the nut from turning. If so, 
loosen and remove this first. In some cases the nut is permanently fastened to one blade, but 
usually it is free. NOTE: some pivot bolts are left-hand threaded (tightening counter-clockwise). 
These will usually have an arrow on the head of the bolt that shows the direction to turn to 
loosen the bolt. 
4. Check for bent parts and straighten or replace as necessary. 
5. Thoroughly clean all parts, including the inside surfaces of the bolt holes, the bolt and the nut. 
6. Using light machine oil (e.g. 3-in-1 Oil), lubricate the bolt, bolt holes and the base of both blades 
around the bolt holes. 
7. Reassemble, first slipping the bolt into the blade. If the bolt is threaded into the blade, tighten it 
firmly. Or, it may be keyed, and will only go in when aligned to a slot in the blade. Be certain to 
place any washers on the bolt as they were before. 
8. Assemble the other blade and any washers or other parts in the order and alignment they were 
in before disassembly. 
9. Tighten the nut onto the bolt.  At this point you should not be able to open the tool easily. 
Begin to loosen the bolt in short increments. Imagine the face of a clock. Start with a five-
minute increment. Remove the tool from the clamp or vise and check its operation. Do this 
repeatedly until the blades are beginning to pass. Now reduce your increments to one-minute 
size. When you are in adjustment, the blades will pass smoothly and easily without wobbling. 
10. Work the tool a few times, and then give it a final wipe to remove excess oil and coat exposed 
metal surfaces with oil.

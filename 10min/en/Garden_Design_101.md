# Garden Design 101

Good design is the foundation of a beautiful, healthy, and sustainable garden. A well-thought-out plan combines the elements of good design—line, form, texture, scent, and color—while incorporating the needs and wishes of the homeowner.

## Hardscape

### Path

- Main paths should be wide enough for at least two people to walk side by side, at least 5 feet.
- For secondary paths where people walk single file, the width should be at least 3 feet.

### Paving

- Give secure footing priority.
- Avoid slick surfaces or loosely set pavers that wobble.
- Use unsifted gravel with sharp edges for gravel paths because they compact better and don’t roll.

### Steps

- Keep garden steps to no more than 6 inches high.
- The depth of each step plus twice the height should be equal to 26 inches. For example, steps with a 6-inch rise would require a run of 14 inches.
- If your garden stairways include more than 10 steps, consider including a landing after every fourth or fifth step.
- A generous landing is necessary whenever a stairway changes direction; landings should be at least as deep as the stairs are wide.

### Patio and Deck

- Consider how you plan to use the space for dining or mingling and the likely number of guests.
- Allow at least 4 square feet of space per person.
- In placing outdoor furniture, leave a 3-foot perimeter around any furniture grouping for comfortable movement.

## Logistics

### Driveway

- Before installing shrubs, walls, or fences, check out sight lines by sitting in your car to make sure views are not blocked.

### Neighbors

- Ensure you know any requirements of your homeowner association and local jurisdiction.
- Consult with neighbors about your ideas if feasible.

### Utilities

- Contact your municipalities and utilities for marking underground lines if you plan to change grades, dig trenches more than 18 inches deep, or dig up patios and sidewalks.

## Design Plan

### Base Map

- Develop a base map on graph paper to show the existing location of buildings, paths, trees, and other significant features.
- It is common for designers to make one square equal to 1 or 2 feet of actual size.
- Use rulers, T-squares, triangles, and landscape templates as needed.
- Next, add lighting, water features, paths, patios, or any other hardscape.
- Chart sun and shade patterns.

### Planting Design

- A good starting size for a border is 8 feet wide by 24 feet long; choose a size that will fit your location as well as your time and budget.
- First, play with the shape of garden beds on your map, then lay out hoses to mark borders for future beds.
- Use a variety of plants (trees, shrubs, perennials, and bulbs) to create a tapestry of foliage and full seasons of blooms.
- Allow room for plants to mature.

## Plants

### Plan for Growth

- Place plants so that they are not crowded at maturity.
- Consult plant tags but know that plants in the Willamette Valley often get bigger than indicated.
- If you must have a full landscape right away, plant with the intent to relocate or remove some plants later.
- You may also use annuals and short-lived perennials as filler plants in new plantings.

### Keep Proper Distance

- Place tall plants (30 inches or taller) at least 2 feet back from walkways and patio edges. Otherwise, these spaces may feel crowded.
- Keep thorny plants like roses away from traffic areas.

### Think Beyond the Bloom

- While flowers are attractive, many plants offer foliage, fruit, and bark for year-long color, form, and texture.
- Extend your garden’s appeal by using fall foliage color and winter interest with fruits, bark, and seed heads.

### Lawn Has Its Place

- A lawn offers a place for the eye to rest from the exuberance of your garden.
- It also provides space to go barefoot or play games.
- Choose a size that is manageable and meets your needs.

### Plant Selection

- Start by making a list of all the plants you want to grow; check their requirements to make sure they will thrive in your soil, moisture, and light conditions.
- Make a chart of these plants with columns for the type (e.g., evergreen shrub), height and width, foliage color, bloom color and time, fragrance, and anything else that is special about this plant.
- Check availability locally.

### Plant Placement

- Use key plants as the basis for creating combinations with other plants.
- Review your chart and choose a few plants with multi-season interests as anchors of your design and build vignettes around them.
- Contrast billowing, airy plants with bold-textured plants.
- Place rounded forms next to spiky forms and use low-mounding or trailing plants at the front of the border to unify the edge.
- Build combinations by surrounding them with complementary plants that bloom at the same time. This will strengthen the visual appeal of your garden.
- In a small garden, too many colors can look chaotic. Pick a cool or a warm color scheme and choose the plants from your plant list.


1. **Color Scheme**
2. **Texture**
3. **Form**

- Use these principles to create contrast in your plant combinations.
- For example, use foliage to bring color to your plantings such as green, blue, yellow, red, and gray variegated.
- Use textures such as bold, spiky, smooth, feathery, and lacy to bring interest to your plantings.
- Use forms such as mounding, spiked, and trailing to create contrast among your plantings.

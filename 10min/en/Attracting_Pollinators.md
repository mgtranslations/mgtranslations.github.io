## Attracting Pollinators to Your Garden

### Pollination & Pollinators

The National Academy of Sciences estimates that one-third of human food and a greater portion of wildlife food comes from plants requiring pollinators to produce fruits and seeds. Helping pollinators thrive yields tangible benefits for all of us.

Common pollinators include birds, bees, butterflies, moths, flies, and beetles. Around our gardens, honey bees and hummingbirds might be the most noticeable. However, native wild bees, such as bumblebees, mining bees, mason bees, sweat bees, leaf-cutting bees, and carpenter bees, make invaluable contributions. Native bees are prolific pollinators—better able to tolerate colder and wetter weather compared to honey bees—they become active earlier in the spring and work longer hours each day.

### Recent Threats to Pollinators

#### Habitat Loss

As wildlife habitats are converted for other uses, it destroys pollinators’ food sources and homes.

#### Pesticides

Bees, butterflies, and most other insects are susceptible to pesticides. Exposure can kill or gradually weaken their ability to fly, forage, and produce young.

#### Invasive Species

Some introduced plants take over natural areas and displace native plants that provide a diversity of food resources and habitat types for native pollinators. See *Invasive Species: What Gardeners Need to Know* for more information.

### Ways to Help Pollinators

#### Provide Food with Flowering Plants Spring Through Fall

Flowers provide nectar (sugar) and pollen (protein) for pollinators and their young. Because different pollinators may have different food preferences, variety is important. Recent research shows that areas with 15 or more species of flowering plants increase bee diversity.

Gardeners who want to conserve bees should strive to provide a minimum of three species of blooming plants at any given time from spring through fall. Place like flowers together to catch the attention of passing pollinators.

#### General Flower Characteristics for Pollinators

Include spring-blooming plants so that early-season native bees have an immediate food source upon emerging from winter dormancy. Plant late summer bloomers to fuel bees that overwinter as adults (e.g., bumblebees). *Plants for Pollinators*, a 10-Minute University™ handout, offers many ideas.

#### Provide Nesting Habitats for Native Bees

Many native bees nest in the ground. A patch of bare soil or a dry bed of sparsely planted ornamental grass clumps is ideal. Covering soil with plastic mulch or frequent rototilling can destroy nests. Other bees nest in abandoned beetle tunnels in dead tree trunks or brush piles. Ideal nesting areas are dry, warm, protected from predators, and close to food sources.

#### Provide Host Plants for Butterflies and Moths

Adult butterflies and moths usually prefer to feed on nectar, but their young feed on plant leaves. This “host plant” is where the adult lays its eggs. Native ornamental trees and shrubs often make great host plants for many species.

#### Use Native and Exotic Plants

Native plants are fantastic host plants for butterflies and moths and provide food for other pollinators. However, home gardeners who favor exotic plants, particularly floriferous annuals and smaller perennials, should not hesitate to use them to maintain a long season of blooms in the garden.

#### Avoid Pesticides

At the first sign of plant distress, collect evidence for a proper diagnosis. Understanding the problem is requisite to taking effective action. Many plant problems, when detected early, can be managed through non-chemical means. Be vigilant in the garden.

Before using systemic pesticides, particularly on plants visited by pollinators, think twice about the benefits relative to the drawbacks. Systemic pesticides protect plant leaves from pests but can be transported in small doses to nectar and pollen. Plant-feeding caterpillars or nectar and pollen-collecting bees can be harmed when feeding on plants protected by systemic pesticides.

If pesticides must be used, follow label instructions to ensure proper application:

- Use the correct concentration.
- Apply under suitable weather conditions.
- Treat the correct part of the plant.

To protect pollinators:

- Avoid treating blooming plants, including weeds.
- Stay away from nesting areas.
- Spray during cooler parts of the day, such as at dusk or in the evening, when most pollinators are less active.

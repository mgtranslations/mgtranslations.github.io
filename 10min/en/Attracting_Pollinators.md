Attracting Pollinators to Your Garden 
Pollination & Pollinators  
The National Academy of Sciences estimates one-third of human food and a greater portion of wildlife 
food comes from plants that require pollinators to produce fruits and seeds. Therefore, helping 
pollinators thrive yields tangible benefits for all of us. 
 
Common pollinators include birds, bees, butterflies, moths, flies, and beetles. Around our gardens, 
honey bees and hummingbirds might be the most noticeable. However, native wild bees, including 
bumblebees, mining bees, mason bees, sweat bees, leaf cutting bees, and carpenter bees make 
invaluable contributions. Native bees are prolific pollinators -- better able to tolerate colder and wetter 
weather compared to honey bees -- they become active earlier in the spring and work longer hours 
each day. 
 
Recent Threats to Pollinators 
Habitat Loss: As wildlife habitats are converted for other uses, it destroys pollinator’s food sources and 
homes.   
Pesticides: Bees, butterflies, and most other insects are susceptible to pesticides. Exposure can kill, or 
gradually weaken the ability to fly, forage, and produce young.  
Invasive Species: Some introduced plants take over natural areas and displace native plants that 
provide a diversity of food resources and habitat types for native pollinators.  See Invasive Species: 
What Gardeners Need to Know for more information. 
 
Ways to Help Pollinators  
Provide Food with Flowering Plants Spring through Fall 
Flowers provide nectar (sugar) and pollen (protein) for pollinators and their young. Because different 
pollinators may have different food preferences (see table below), variety is important. Recent 
research shows that areas that include 15 or more species of flowering plants increase bee diversity.  
Gardeners who want to conserve bees should strive to, as a general rule, provide a minimum of three 
species of blooming plants at any given time spring through fall. Place like flowers together to catch 
the attention of passing pollinators.

Include spring-blooming plants so that early-season, native bees have an immediate food source upon 
emerging from winter dormancy. Plant late summer bloomers to fuel bees that over-winter as adults 
(i.e., bumblebees).  Plants for Pollinators, a 10-Minute University™ handout, offers many ideas. 
 
Provide Nesting Habitats for Native Bees 
Many native bees nest in the ground. A patch of bare soil or a dry bed of sparsely planted ornamental 
grass clumps are ideal. Covering soil with plastic mulch or frequent rototilling can destroy nests. Other 
bees nest in abandoned beetle tunnels in dead tree trunks or brush piles. Ideal nesting areas are dry, 
warm, protected from predators, and are close to food sources. 
 
Provide Host Plants for Butterflies and Moths 
Adult butterflies and moths usually prefer to feed on nectar, but their young feed on plant leaves. This 
“host plant” is where the adult lays its eggs. Native, ornamental trees and shrubs often are great host 
plants for many species.  
 
Use Native and Exotic Plants 
Native plants are fantastic host plants for butterflies and moths and provide food for other pollinators. 
However, home gardeners who favor exotic plants, particularly floriferous annuals and smaller 
perennials, should not hesitate in using them to maintain a long-season of blooms in the garden. 
 
Avoid Pesticides 
At first sign of plant distress, collect evidence for a proper diagnosis. Understanding the problem is 
requisite to taking effective action. Many plant problems, when detected early, can be managed 
through non-chemical means. So be vigilant in the garden.  
Before using systemic pesticides, particularly on plants visited by pollinators, think twice about the 
benefits relative to the drawbacks.  Systemic pesticides protect plant leaves from pests, and can be 
transported in small doses to nectar and pollen. Plant-feeding caterpillars or nectar and pollen-
collecting bees can be harmed when feeding on plants protected by systemic pesticides.    
If pesticides must be used, follow label instructions so that it is applied at the right concentration, 
under suitable weather conditions, to the correct part of the plant, etc. To protect pollinators, don’t 
treat blooming plants, including weeds; stay away from nesting areas; and spray in the cooler parts of 
the day, such as at dusk or in the evening, when most pollinators are less active.

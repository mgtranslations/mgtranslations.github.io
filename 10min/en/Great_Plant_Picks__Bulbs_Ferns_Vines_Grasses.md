Great Plant Picks (GPP) is the primary educational program of the Elisabeth C. Miller Botanical Garden. In 2001 the first list debuted 
with recommendations for building a comprehensive palette of outstanding plants for the maritime Pacific Northwest. To date over 
1,000 exceptional plants have been selected for gardeners living west of the Cascade Mountains from Eugene, Oregon, USA to 
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  
 
GPP plants selected for this list meet these criteria: can live in a variety of soils, need moderate or less supplemental water, can 
tolerate heat, are cold hardy in USDA zone 7, are not prone to disease/pest problems, and offer more than 1-season of interest in the 
garden. Many GPP plants also offer ecological benefits (pollinators, bird food, habitat for wildlife, etc.)

# Orchard Mason Bee

### Overview

The orchard mason bee (*Osmia lignaria*) is an effective early pollinator native to the Western US and Canada. It emerges in the spring before honeybees. As a pollinator, it is far more efficient than the honeybee by transferring more pollen and visiting more types and numbers of flowers.

The male mason bee does not sting. A female is considered non-aggressive, stinging only when handled roughly or when trapped under clothing. Mason bees are solitary, with many queens laying 14 to 40 eggs. They do not produce honey. They feed on nectar and collect pollen and nectar to feed larvae as they hatch.

A mason bee is slightly smaller than a honeybee. They look like a small black fly, but flies only have one pair of wings, whereas bees have two pairs. In the Portland area, we also have horn-faced mason bees (*Osmia cornifrons*), which are not native. They are similar in color to honeybees but are smaller and cohabit with orchard mason bees. Mason bees fly after air temperatures warm up to about 55°F.

### Life Cycle

Mason bees are active in your garden for one to three months beginning in early spring. During the cold weather months, a fully formed adult bee stays in its cocoon in the nest. When temperatures rise to 50°F for a couple of days in early spring, the adult bee chews through the cocoon and emerges. Emergence continues for up to two weeks.

When eggs were laid the previous spring, the male eggs were placed near the entrance of the nest while females were placed in the back. Thus, males emerge first. They wait for females to emerge in order to mate. Females begin nesting about 3 to 4 days after mating, preferring existing holes for their nests. She will choose a hole slightly larger than her body, usually about 1/4 to 3/8 inch in diameter. She will place a mud plug at the bottom of the hole and begin to bring in nectar and pollen.

When she has stored enough food for the young, she will lay an egg on the pollen and seal the cell with a thin mud partition. She then repeats the process until the entire length of the tunnel is used. The female stores the semen from mating and only uses it to fertilize the egg if she wants to produce a female offspring. An unfertilized egg will become male.

A few days after eggs are laid, larvae hatch. Larvae feed on the pollen and nectar stored in the nest. After 10 days, the larvae spin a cocoon and pupate within the cell. Near the end of summer, the bee transforms to the adult stage called an imago but remains in the cocoon throughout the winter.

### Requirements for Mason Bees

The nesting holes for mason bees should be 1/4 to 3/8 inch in diameter and preferably 6 inches deep. The hole must be open only on the entry end. Mason bees prefer wood (not pressure-treated or cedar) or homes made specifically for them, such as wood laminate blocks, pre-drilled holes, or paper straws in which to nest. However, they will use other materials and locations like wood siding or electrical plugs.

Place the nest in a dry, protected site, preferably with east or southeast exposure. Having a source of clay-like mud is important. If there is not a source of mud, the bees will go elsewhere. Insert a paper straw liner into each hole to make retrieval of the cocoons easier if you plan to "wash" your bees in the fall. Wood laminate bee blocks come apart for easy cocoon retrieval.

### Parasites, Predators & Pathogens

Several parasites, predators, and pathogens can injure or kill mason bees:

- **Small Chalcid Wasps**: These pierce mason bee cocoons and lay eggs in them. These wasps emerge later than the mason bee, so you can decrease the risk by taking down mason bee nests by the first of June. Store the cocoons in a warm place (a garage or shed works well). Placing the nesting material in a mesh bag helps protect them from wasps.
- **Krombein Mites**: These reproduce within a mason bee cell and feed on the pollen stored for the young bee larva. By the end of summer, the cell is packed with empty pollen grains and thousands of mites.
- **Chalkbrood**: This fungus kills bees in the larval stage and is spread when bees come in contact with it as they emerge.

You can rid your bees of mites and chalkbrood by cleaning the cocoons between October and December. Adults are fully developed at this time and can withstand this process.

#### Cleaning Process

1. Wash your bees in water no warmer than 50°F to avoid waking them up.
2. Soak the cocoons for no more than 5 minutes in cool water with a mixture of 0.05% bleach (1 tablespoon bleach per 1 gallon of water).
3. Rinse well under cool water to remove all traces of bleach.
4. Dry on a clean paper towel or screen until cocoons are completely dry.
5. Sort and discard damaged, diseased, or parasitized cocoons. Remove larvae affected by chalkbrood (mummified larvae are usually black in color).
6. Put clean, air-dried cocoons in a small container with air holes and store in the refrigerator until the following spring.

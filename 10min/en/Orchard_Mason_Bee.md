Orchard Mason Bee 
Overview 
The orchard mason bee, Osmia lignaria, is an effective early pollinator native to the Western US and 
Canada. It emerges in the spring before honeybees. As a pollinator, it is far more efficient than the 
honeybee by transferring more pollen and visiting more types and numbers of flowers. 
 
The male mason bee does not sting. A female is considered non-aggressive, stings only when handled 
‘roughly,’ or when trapped under clothing. Mason bees are solitary – many queens laying 14 to 40 
eggs.  They do not produce honey. They feed on nectar and collect pollen and nectar to feed larva as 
they hatch.  
                                                      
A mason bee is slightly smaller than a honeybee. They look like a small black fly, but flies only have 
one pair of wings and bees have two pairs. In the Portland area we also have horn-faced mason bees 
(Osmia cornifrons) that are not native. They are similar color to honeybees, but are smaller, and co-
habit with orchard mason bees. Mason bees fly after air temperature warms up to about 55⁰F.  
 
Life Cycle  
Mason bees are active in your garden for one to three months beginning in early spring. During the 
cold weather months, a fully formed adult bee stays in its cocoon in the nest. When temperatures 
rise to 50⁰F for a couple of days in early spring, the adult bee chews through the cocoon and 
emerges.  Emergence continues for up to two weeks. 
 
When eggs were laid the previous spring, the male eggs were placed near the entrance of the nest 
while females were placed in the back. Thus, males emerge first. They wait for females to emerge in 
order to mate. Females begin nesting about 3 to 4 days after mating, preferring existing holes for 
their nests. She will choose a hole slightly larger than her body, usually about 1/4 to 3/8 inch in 
diameter. She will place a mud plug at the bottom of the hole and begin to bring in nectar and pollen.   
 
When she has stored enough food for the young, she will lay an egg on the pollen and seal the cell 
with a thin mud partition. She then repeats the process until the entire length of the tunnel is used. 
The female stores the semen from mating and only uses it to fertilize the egg if she wants to get a 
female offspring. An unfertilized egg will become male.  
 
A few days after eggs are laid, larvae hatch. Larvae feed on the pollen and nectar stored in the nest.  
After 10 days, the larvae spin a cocoon and pupate within the cell. Near the end of summer, the bee 
transforms to the adult stage called an imago but remains in the cocoon throughout the winter.  
 
Requirements for Mason Bees 
The nesting holes for mason bees should be 1/4 to 3/8 inch in diameter and preferably 6 inches deep. 
The hole must be open only on the entry end. Mason bees prefer wood (not pressure-treated or 
 

cedar) or homes made specifically for them such as wood laminate blocks, pre-drilled holes or paper 
straws in which to nest but will use other materials and locations like wood siding or electrical plugs.   
 
Place the nest in a dry, protected site preferably with east or southeast exposure. Having a source of 
clay-like mud is important.  If there is not a source of mud, the bees will go elsewhere. Insert a paper 
straw liner into each hole to make retrieval of the cocoons easier if you plan to ‘wash’ your bees in 
the fall.  Wood laminate bee blocks come apart for easy cocoon retrieval. 
 
Parasites, Predators & Pathogens 
Several parasites, predators and pathogens can injure or kill mason bees. Small Chalcid wasps pierce 
mason bee cocoons and lay eggs in them. These wasps emerge later than the mason bee, so you can 
decrease the risk by taking down mason bee nests by the first of June. Store the cocoons in a warm 
place (a garage or shed works well). Placing the nesting material in a mesh bag helps protect them 
from wasps. The Krombein mite reproduces within a mason bee cell and feeds on the pollen stored 
for the young bee larva. By the end of summer, the cell is packed with empty pollen grains and 
thousands of mites. Chalkbrood is a fungus that kills the bees in the larval stage and is spread when 
bees come in contact with it as they emerge. 
You can rid your bees of mites and chalkbrood by cleaning the cocoons between October and 
December. Adults are fully developed at this time and can withstand this process. Wash your bees in 
water no warmer than 50⁰F so as not to ‘wake up’ the bees. Soak the cocoons for no more than 5 
minutes, in cool water with a mixture of 0.05 percent bleach (1 tablespoon bleach per 1 gallon 
water). Rinse well under cool water to remove all traces of bleach. Dry on a clean paper towel or 
screen until cocoons are completely dry. Sort and discard damaged, diseased or parasitized cocoons 
and remove larvae effected by chalkbrood (mummified larvae usually are black in color). Put clean, 
air-dried cocoons in a small container with air holes and store in the refrigerator until the following 
spring.

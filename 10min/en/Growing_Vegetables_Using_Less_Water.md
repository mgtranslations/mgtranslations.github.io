## Vegetable Gardening Using Less Water  

### Overview  
The OSU Extension Small Farms division has been testing the feasibility of “dry farming” organic vegetables commercially. Dry farming relies on residual soil moisture from the rainy season to grow crops and works best in areas receiving 20 inches or more of annual rainfall. Success requires careful management of soil moisture through site selection, soil preparation, and protection of the soil surface. Not all vegetables are suitable candidates for this approach, so variety selection is important. This handout draws lessons from this research for the home gardener to grow vegetables while conserving water and soil.

### Prepare the Site  
- Increase the water-holding capacity of the soil by adding organic matter (5–7% is ideal).  
- Grow a fall cover crop like red and white clover, Phacelia, or buckwheat. Cut it down and turn it into the soil in spring.  
- Adding compost, whether commercial or homemade, is another option.  
- If your garden soil is rich with clay, put it to use. Clay soil holds more water and nutrients than other types of soil. Amend clay with organic matter to make it more workable.  
- For spring planting, the best time to prepare your site is the fall.

### Minimize the Loss of Soil Moisture  
- Cover the soil surface with a layer of organic mulch to keep it from drying out. Organic mulch helps keep the soil cool, so it should be applied only after plants begin to grow. Examples include:  
  - Commercially composted yard debris  
  - Your own compost  
  - Grass clippings (if free from herbicides or pesticides)  
  - Wheat straw or chopped-up leaves  
  - Cardboard, burlap bags, and newspaper are also options.  
- Inorganic mulches like red and black plastic may be used to warm soil, prevent evaporation, and suppress weed growth.  
- Mulches provide habitat for slugs; apply non-toxic slug bait.  
- Keep soil weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients and water.  
- Keep the top 2 inches of soil around plants loose by hoeing to create “dust mulch.” This helps fill in any cracks in the soil, reducing evaporation.  
- Avoid walking on surfaces where plants grow to reduce compaction and preserve the soil’s water-holding capacity.

### Adopt Techniques to Make Efficient Use of Irrigation Water  
- Use drip irrigation to minimize evaporation and deliver water where needed.  
- Group plants according to their water needs into zones.  
- Use irrigation timers to regulate frequency and volume of water; zoned control improves efficiency.  
- To reduce evaporation, water early in the morning before the soil and air warm up.

### Time Your Planting  
- Rely on soil moisture and temperature to determine when to begin planting preparation.  
  - To test for moisture, squeeze a ball of soil in your hand. If it stays in a ball yet crumbles easily, it is ready.  
  - Use a soil thermometer to determine when to plant seeds.  
- Consult a planting calendar or seed package for specific temperature requirements.  
- Often, suitable varieties are not commercially available or are not available at the correct time to plant. Start seeds indoors so plants will get a head start before the heat.  
- Plant varieties that mature early, before the onset of summer heat. Some may also be planted in late summer for fall harvest. Examples include:  
  - Lettuce  
  - Cabbage  
  - Swiss chard  
  - Broccoli  
- Use cloches, “walls-o-water,” and cold frames to help warm-season plants like tomatoes, peppers, and melons get an early start.  
- Try planting winter crops such as purple sprouting broccoli, cabbage, radicchio, etc.

### Apply Special Planting Techniques  
- Pre-soak large seeds overnight prior to planting; this helps speed germination.  
- Prior to planting small seeds, press the soil surface firmly and gently with a board. This is thought to increase soil capillary action, which brings moisture to the surface where seeds and plant roots can access it.  
- For the same reason, press the soil around plants as they are transplanted.  
- Plant in blocks rather than rows. Plant close together to shade the soil. Place smaller plants in the shade of taller ones.  
- If you wish to grow without regular irrigation, plant further apart—twice the normal distance—to reduce competition for water and nutrients.

### Choose Drought-Tolerant Vegetable Varieties  
- Heirloom vegetable varieties may be more drought-tolerant if they were developed before there was running water for irrigation.  
- Try varieties recommended by dry farmers (visit OSU Dry Farm Program websites listed below).  
- Plant more vining crops like squash, beans (dry shell types), peas, and melons; they often require less water.  
- Consider using locally grown seeds. While they are not specifically grown for drought conditions, they are more likely to be adapted to the local climate.

## Make Your Garden More Climate-Resilient: Plants

Earth's current warming trend results in melting glaciers, rising sea levels, increasing ocean acidity, and more frequent and severe droughts and floods. The Pacific Northwest has seen prolonged drought, increasing wildfire incidence and severity, heat waves, insect outbreaks, and tree diseases. Reduced snowpack results in earlier peak flows in rivers and streams, which reduces water supplies. In addition to these trends, climate change brings erratic, extreme weather events (heat waves, heavy rain) in greater frequency.

How do we garden in these times? This handout offers ideas for building resiliency into the garden via plant choices and growing practices.

## What We Know

- **USDA Cold Hardiness Zone:**  
  Historically, this was a main consideration for plant selection. Hardiness zones are calculated using a location’s average low temperatures for the past 30 years. The warming trend has necessitated updates, and we expect zone designations will continue to shift.

- **Heat Tolerance and Water Needs:**  
  The warming climate makes a plant’s heat tolerance and water needs important criteria for garden use. Indications of a plant’s requirements can be gleaned from its native environment. Additional clues include:  
  - Leaf colors: Silver leaves reflect light; red anthocyanin increases stress tolerance.  
  - Texture: Hairy surfaces or waxy coatings reduce water loss.  
  - Size/shape: Small leaves or curled/narrow forms lose less moisture.

- **Photosynthesis Groups:**  
  Plants can be categorized into three photosynthesis groups: C3, C4, and CAM types.  
  - Most plants are C3, which close stomata (pores) when it’s too hot. During this period, photorespiration—a wasteful sidetrack of photosynthesis—is more likely to occur.

  - C4 and CAM plants have adaptations to minimize photorespiration. Examples:  
    - **C4:** Corn, sugar cane, crab grass  
    - **CAM:** Cacti, succulents, pineapple, jade plant, Aeonium, Sedum, orchid, Agave

- **Vegetables and Annual Ornamentals:**  
  These thrive in rich soil and plentiful water. In contrast, pampered growing conditions for longer-living plants (trees, shrubs, perennials) can lead to tender shoots that invite pests and a weak structure prone to injury from snow, ice, and wind.

## Potential Climate Mitigation

- Select plants that can tolerate heat or even thrive in heat in your climate.
- Choose plants that require little to no supplemental water after establishment.
- Identify strong performers. If a particular plant did well during a heat wave or extreme weather event, consider adding more.
- Adjust planting calendars to take advantage of a longer growing season.

## What To Do

### Adjust Planting Calendar

- The warming climate provides opportunities to plant earlier in the spring and continue growing into fall.
- Early spring and late fall growing carry risks of sudden cold spells, heavy rain, and/or extended drought. Making garden soil more climate-resilient and using season extenders can moderate risks and improve plant performance.

### Use Climate-Adapted Plants

- The origin of a plant gives clues to its cultural requirements. Select plants that match your garden conditions and the level of care you can provide.
- Native plants of your ecoregion are good candidates if their habitat is similar to conditions in your garden.
- For Pacific Northwest gardens, many Mediterranean-origin plants match the summer-dry, winter-wet climate. They thrive in sunny areas with free-draining soil containing low organic matter.
- CAM plants are well-adapted to hot summers and can be used strategically in the garden.

### Use Plant Trial Results

#### Northwest Plant Evaluations

- [Grevillea](https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/evaluating-grevillea-western-oregon)
- [Hebe](https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/hebe-landscape-evaluation)
- [Rockrose](https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/rockrose-cistus-spp-and-halimium-spp-evaluation-western-oregon)

#### Climate Ready Landscape Plant Project

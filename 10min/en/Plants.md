Make Your Garden More Climate-Resilient: Plants 
Earth current warming trend results in melting glaciers, rising sea level, increasing ocean acidity, 
and more frequent and severe droughts and floods. The Pacific Northwest has seen prolonged 
drought, increasing wildfire incidence and severity, heat waves, insect outbreaks, and tree 
diseases. Reduced snowpack results in earlier peak flows in rivers and streams which reduces 
water supplies. In addition to these trends, climate change brings erratic, extreme weather 
events (heat wave, heavy rain) in greater frequency.

How do we garden in these times? This handout offers ideas for building resiliency into the 
garden via plant choices and growing practices. 
 
What We Know 
• USDA Cold Hardiness Zone was a main consideration for plant selection. Hardiness zone is 
calculated using a location’s average low temperatures for the past 30 years. The warming 
trend has necessitated its update and we expect zone designations will shift. 
• The warming climate makes a plant’s heat tolerance and water needs an important criteria 
in garden use. We gain indications of a plant’s requirement from its native environment. 
Additional clues come from leaf colors (silver color leaves reflect light, red anthocyanin 
increases stress tolerance), texture (hairy surface or waxy coating reduces water loss), size/ 
shape (small leaves, curled/narrow forms lose less moisture). 
• Plants can be categorized into three photosynthesis groups: C3, C4 and CAM types. Most 
plants are of the C3 type, which close stomata (pores) when it’s too hot. During this period, 
photorespiration, a wasteful sidetrack of photosynthesis, is more likely to happen.

• C4 and CAM plants have adaptations to minimize photorespiration. Examples: C4 (corn, 
sugar cane, crab grass), CAM (Cacti, succulents, pineapple, jade plant, Aeonium, Sedum, 
orchid, Agave). https://askabiologist.asu.edu/cam-plants 
• Vegetables and annual ornamental plants thrive in rich soil and plentiful water. In contrast, 
pampered growing conditions for longer-living plants (trees, shrubs, perennials) can lead to 
tender shoots inviting pests to feast upon, and a weak structure prone to injury from snow, 
ice, and wind. 
 
Potential Climate Mitigation 
• Select plants that can tolerate heat or even thrive in heat in your climate. 
• Select plants that require little to no supplemental water after establishment. 
• Select strong performers. If a particular plant did well during a heat wave or extreme 
weather event, consider adding more. 
• Adjust planting calendar to take advantage of a longer growing season.  
 
What To Do 
• Adjust planting calendar  
 

o The warming climate avails the opportunity to plant earlier in the spring and to continue 
growing into fall.  
o Early spring and late fall growing has the risk of sudden cold spells, heavy rain, and/or 
extended drought. Making garden soil more climate resilient and using season extenders 
can moderate risk and improve plant performance. 
• Use climate-adapted plants. The origin of a plant gives clues to its cultural requirement. 
Select plants that match your garden conditions and the level of care you can provide. 
Native plants of your ecoregion are good candidates if their habitat is similar to conditions in 
your garden. For Pacific Northwest gardens, many Mediterranean-origin plants match the 
summer dry, winter wet climate. They do well in sunny areas that have free-draining soil 
containing low organic matter. CAM plants are well-adapted to hot summers and can be 
used strategically in the garden. 
• Use plant trial results

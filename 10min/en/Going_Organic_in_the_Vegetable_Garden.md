Going Organic in Vegetable Gardening  
 
What is “Organic Gardening”? 
Adopting “Organic Gardening” methods means to stop using synthetic products.  Instead, only naturally-
occurring products that enrich the soil and control and treat diseases, pests, and weeds are used.  
Everything else stays the same; you plant, tend, water, and harvest just as you did before.  You can switch to 
organic methods completely or use a combination of methods.  For instance, you may choose to eliminate 
synthetic pesticides and herbicides but continue to use some synthetic fertilizers. 
 
Compost Builds Healthy Soil 
Good soil is key to successful gardening, and adding composted organic matter improves soil.  Begin a new 
garden by adding 2 to 4 inches of compost each year.  Use more for heavy clay or very sandy soil.  About half 
of the organic matter in compost breaks down each year.  Therefore, organic matter builds up in your soil over 
time.  If you want quicker results, make a raised bed of native soil, compost, sand, and manure.   
Adding compost to soil improves its structure and long-term health.  However, it is not a reliable source of 
fertilizer.  Where robust growth is crucial, as for a vegetable garden, add additional fertilizers. 
 
Organic Fertilizers Add Fertility 
• Soil loses fertility over time: plants use nutrients as they grow, and winter rain washes away soluble 
nutrients.  As a result, we need to add fertilizers each year.   
• Plants can only use nutrients that are soluble; many organic fertilizers contain insoluble nutrients which 
must be broken down by soil organisms before becoming usable by plants.   
• A pre-mixed, balanced organic fertilizer containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) is an 
easier way to begin.  
• If you choose to make your own mix, combine fast- and slow-acting fertilizers to feed your plants during 
the entire growing season.  Common fast-acting organic fertilizers (with their N-P-K assay) include fish 
emulsion (5-1-1); blood meal (15-1-1); fish meal (10-4-0); and bat guano (10-3-1).  Slow-acting fertilizers 
include cottonseed meal (7-2-1); alfalfa (2-1-2); bone meal (2-15-0); soft rock phosphate (0-3-0); kelp meal 
(0-0-10); and greensand (0-0-5).  Work slow-acting fertilizers into your soil several months before planting.  
Soil organisms are active in warmer temperatures. 
• High soil fertility is critical for seedling and transplants to thrive.  Thriving seedlings are more able to resist 
pests and diseases and to compete with weeds.  A soluble fertilizer like liquid fish emulsion helps small 
plants get well-established quickly.  Once the soil warms up, nutrients from slow-acting fertilizers will 
become available to plants to carry them through ‘til harvest.   
• Over wintering cover crops can minimize soil erosion and compression.  As they grow, these plants trap 
soil nutrients in them so less is washed away by rain.  In the spring, cut down the stems and leaves of cover 
crops before they bloom and add them to the compost pile.  Turn the soil to kill roots.  
 
Organic Techniques for Pest Control 
• Be observant.  The first step in pest control is to identify the pest causing the damage.  Using slug bait or 
pesticides designed for insect control will be of no help if birds are the source of the damage.  You can get 
help from Master Gardeners online at www.metromastergardeners.org or call the phone numbers listed 
below.   
• Healthy plants are less likely to attract pests and more capable of outgrowing damage.   
 

• Be especially vigilant of pest and disease control when your vegetables are seedlings.  Small, tender plants 
can be quickly ravaged; once large enough, plants can sustain some damage without loss of yield. 
• Isolating seedlings and transplants from pests is one of the most effective organic pest control methods.  
Floating row covers will exclude flying insects and birds.  They can be laid directly on top of plants and held 
down along the sides with rocks or boards.  As plants grow, they will push the row cover upward.  At that 
point, the plants are large enough to be unattractive to many pests.  These covers also warm the soil to 
encourage faster growth of seedlings. 
• In Western Oregon, slugs are the No. 1 garden pest.  The key is controlling them prior to planting seeds or 
transplants.  Baits become far less effective when slugs have tender seedlings to feed on; they can mow 
down an entire row of tiny plants in a single night of feeding.  Hand picking at night or in hiding spots 
during the day, beer traps, or organic slug bait containing iron phosphate can all be effective.   
• Beneficial insects are insects that prey on garden pests and help reduce the pest population in your 
garden.  The nectar and pollen of small-flowered plants attract adult beneficial insects to your garden.  A 
perennial herb garden of mint, oregano, marjoram, and thyme blooms at various times during the 
summer; these blooms attract adult beneficial insects to feed in your garden.  If they visit, some will lay 
eggs that hatch into larvae which prey on insect pests.   
• If all else fails, organic pesticides can be used to eliminate damaging pests.  Identify the pest before 
choosing a pesticide that is specific to the pest you are trying to control.  An example is using Bacillus 
thuringiensis to control cabbage butterfly larvae on plants of the cabbage family.  Broad-spectrum 
pesticides kill indiscriminately, hurting bees, beneficial insects and soil organisms.  Rotenone, Neem, and 
Pyrethrins are examples of broad-spectrum organic pesticides. 
 
Organic Weed Control Methods 
• Annual weeds–ones that sprout from seeds each year–are best controlled by preventing them from going 
to seed and by hoeing and hand pulling the seedlings.  Attacking them when they are small and easily 
pulled is the best method.  Mulching with an organic material, like compost or straw, can smother weed 
seeds.  You should do this in the summer after the soil has warmed up.  When planting, using transplants 
rather than seeds gives transplants a 3- to 4-week jump on competing weeds; tightly-spaced transplants 
can shade out small weed-seedlings.  Again, this method works best with healthy, rapidly growing plants 
that can outgrow the weeds.   
• Perennial weeds–ones that come back in the same spot in your garden year after year–can be difficult to 
control.  These weeds need to be removed before you plant vegetables.  Sheet mulch is an alternative to 
weeding:  smother the weeds with thick layers of newspaper or cardboard.  The layers can be laid down 
and soil hauled in to build beds on top of the sheet mulch.  Over time, the sheet mulch breaks down and 
can be incorporated into the soil.

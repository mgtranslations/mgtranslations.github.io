## Seminar Recommendations  
- Apply to most ornamental gardens and landscapes  
- Are based on appropriate, current plant and soil science  

---

## Unmanaged Urban Soils  
- Are heavily compacted: poor water and air movement  
- Have abrupt layers  
- Often have low organic matter  
- Need to be tested before selecting plants or adding amendments  

---

### Compaction  
- Created by vehicles, people, and animals  
- Reduces water and air movement, and therefore root movement  

---

## An Ideal Landscape Mulch Will...  
- Enhance water infiltration and retention  
- Enhance gas transfer  
- Moderate soil temperatures  
- Reduce erosion and compaction  
- Improve soil structure  
- Provide mineral nutrients  
- Neutralize pollutants  
- Enhance beneficial microbes and insects  
- Suppress pathogens and pests  
- Be cheap, easy to find, and easy to apply  
- Not detract from aesthetics of the landscape

## Impacts of Landscape Mulches Compared to Bare Urban Soils

|--------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|

**Key:**  
- $ = low cost  
- $$ = moderate cost  
- $$$ = high cost  
- N/LC = nursery/landscape center  
- HI = home improvement store  
- A/U/TS = arborist/utilities/tree service

## Types of Mulches  
### Living  
- Cover crops, ground covers  

### Synthetic  
- Geotextiles, plastics, rubber  

### Inorganic  
- Brick, decomposed granite, lava rock, stone pavers, tumbled glass  

### Organic  
- Bark, coir, compost, leaves, nutshells, pine needles, straw, wood chips  

---

## Synthetic Mulches  
- Not a permanent solution to weed control  
- Can damage the health of the landscape system  
- Sheet mulches reduce water and gas transport  
- Rubber mulches are flammable and may leach harmful chemicals  
- Best used for crop production or where no plant material is desired  

---

## Problems with Cardboard & Newspaper Sheet Mulches  
- Can induce anaerobic conditions if used on wet, poorly drained soils  
- Will become hydrophobic if allowed to dry out  
- Can become pest havens for termites and rodents  

---

## Effectiveness of Inorganic and Organic Mulches  
- Weed control improves with mulch depth  
- Permeability increases with mulch coarseness  
- Greatest benefits and fewest drawbacks with deep, coarse mulches  

---

## Decomposition of Organic Mulches  
### Dependent on Environment  
- **Moisture:** More moisture = faster decomposition  
- **Temperature:** Warmer temperature = faster decomposition  
- **Soil Microbe Population:** Diverse population = faster decomposition  

### Dependent on C:N Ratio  
- **Rapid (days to weeks):** Grass clippings, leaves, manures  
- **Moderate (about six months):** Composts  
- **Slow (up to several years):** Wood chips, hardwood bark, peat  

**Note:** High cellulose and phenolic content will decrease decomposition rate. Replacement rate depends on decomposition rate.  

---

## Organic Mulches Can...  
- Provide a slow release of macro- and micro-nutrients  
- Improve soil structure by reducing compaction  
- Enhance establishment of trees and shrubs in low-maintenance landscapes  
- Enhance beneficial microbes, which can outcompete many pathogens in healthy soils  
- Enhance soil macrofauna biodiversity  

---

## Basic Comparisons Between Inorganic and Organic Mulches  
### Inorganic  
- Good choice for regions where water is limited and organic matter is naturally low  
- Low replacement rate, but does not contribute nutrients to the soil  

### Organic  
- Good choice for regions where water availability ensures optimal organic matter level (5-10%)  
- Decomposition requires continual replacement  

---

## Problems with Fine-Textured Mulches  
- Includes sawdust and some composts  
- Deep applications will lead to anaerobic soil conditions  
- Often become compacted into impervious layers  

---

## Problems with Compost  
- Possibility of toxic plant materials or byproducts  
- Excess nutrients can contaminate watersheds (e.g., phosphate requires monitoring)  
- Contamination with broadleaf herbicides can injure or kill ornamentals  
- Unregulated compost can contain pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxins (e.g., mercury accumulations in golf course turf)  

### Using Compost as a Mulch  
- Choose compost that has been analyzed and certified, or make your own with contaminant-free materials  
- Use thin layers to reduce problems associated with fine-textured mulches and nutrient overload  
- Cover the compost layer with a coarser organic mulch to prevent erosion and weed establishment (the "mulch sandwich")  

---

## Problems with Coarse Woody Mulches  
### Bark Mulches  
- Can be contaminated with salt or weed seeds  
- Bark contains waxes that prevent absorption and release of water in landscapes  
- Softwood bark mulches are often not "people friendly" due to tiny, sharp fibers  

### Arborist Wood Chips  
- Concerns about high carbon:nitrogen ratio – will this cause a nitrogen deficiency?  
- Will diseased wood transfer pathogens if used for chips?  

---

## Nitrogen Availability  
- Wood chip mulches have a high C:N ratio, leading to a localized nitrogen deficiency at the mulch-soil interface  
- Wood chip mulches do not cause nitrogen deficiency in established plants  
- High C:N ratio in wood chips probably prevents germination of some weed seeds  

---

## Fungal Pathogens and Wood Chips  
- Armillaria, Cytospora, Thyronectria, and Verticillium can survive on large wood segments for months  
- Survival is enhanced if wood chips are incorporated into soil  
- No evidence that pathogens in mulch can infect roots below the soil surface  

---

## Fungal Communities in Wood Chips  
- Fungal species in wood chips are generally decomposers, not pathogens  
- In healthy (aerobic) soils, beneficial fungi probably outcompete pathogenic fungi  
- Healthy plants are not susceptible to opportunistic pathogens  

---

## Wood Chip Mulches for Landscapes  
### Weed Suppression by Wood Chips  
- Highly effective – better than herbicides  
- Cost-effective – low to no cost materials  

### How Do Wood Chips Inhibit Weeds?  
- Inhibit weeds through allelopathic chemicals  
- Decrease nitrogen levels at the soil interface  
- Reduce light needed by photodormant seeds  
- Reduce light availability to buried leaves  
- **Depth is critical:** Less than 3 inches leads to increased weeds  

---

## Mulch Strategies Using Coarse Organic Materials  
- Fresh wood chips have the highest nutrient content  
- Begin mulch application before annual weeds are established (spring or fall)  
- Remove perennial weeds in early spring when root resources are lowest  
- Prune or mow perennial weeds at root crown; pulling destroys soil structure  
- Remove all noxious weed materials from the site to prevent rerooting  
- Thick layers (6-8 inches for ornamental sites, 8-12 inches for restoration sites and blackberry/ivy control) of coarse materials are best for weed control and water conservation  
- Keep mulch away from trunks of trees and shrubs  
- Pull any resprouting plants; the mulch layer prevents erosion and facilitates pulling  
- Replace mulch as needed to maintain appropriate depth (minimum depth of 4 inches for weed control). This depends on decomposition rate

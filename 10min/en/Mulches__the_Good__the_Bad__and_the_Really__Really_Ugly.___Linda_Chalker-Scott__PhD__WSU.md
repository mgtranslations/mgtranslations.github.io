Seminar recommendations 
 Apply to most ornamental gardens and landscapes 
 Are based on appropriate, current plant and soil science 
Unmanaged urban soils ...  
 are heavily compacted:  poor water and air movement 
 have abrupt layers 
 often have low organic matter 
 need to be tested before selecting plants or adding amendments 
Compaction 
 Created by vehicles, people & animals 
 Reduces water and air movement, and therefore root movement 
An ideal landscape mulch will... 
 Enhance water infiltration and retention Enhance gas transfer 
 Moderate soil temperatures   Reduce erosion and compaction 
 Improve soil structure    Provide mineral nutrients 
 Neutralize pollutants    Enhance beneficial microbes and insects 
 Suppress pathogens and pests   Be cheap, easy to find, and easy to apply 
 Not detract from aesthetics of landscape 
Impacts of landscape mulches compared to bare urban soils

Mulches  
 Living:  Cover crops, ground covers 
 Synthetic:  Geotextiles, plastics, rubber 
 Inorganic:  Brick, decomposed granite, lava rock, stone pavers, tumbled glass  
 Organic:  Bark, coir, compost, leaves, nutshells, pine needles, straw, wood chips  
Synthetic mulches 
 Not a permanent solution to weed control 
 Can damage health of landscape system 
 Sheet mulches reduce water and gas transport 
 Rubber mulches are flammable and may leach harmful chemicals 
 Best used for crop production or where no plant material is desired 
Problems with cardboard & newspaper sheet mulches 
 Can induce anaerobic conditions if used on wet, poorly drained soils 
 Will become hydrophobic if allowed to dry out 
 Can become pest havens for termites and rodents 
Effectiveness of inorganic and organic mulches – numerous studies 
 Weed control improves with mulch depth 
 Permeability increases with mulch coarseness 
 Greatest benefits and fewest drawbacks with deep, coarse mulches 
Decomposition of organic mulches dependent on environment 
 Moisture (more moisture = faster decomposition) 
 Temperature (warmer temperature = faster decomposition) 
 Soil microbe population (diverse population = faster decomposition) 
Decomposition of organic mulches dependent on C:N ratio 
 Grass clippings, leaves, manures: Rapid (days to weeks) 
 Composts: Moderate (about six months) 
 Wood chips, hardwood bark, peat: Slow (up to several years)  
 High cellulose and phenolic content will decrease decomposition rate 
 Replacement rate depends on decomposition rate 
Organic mulches can... 
 provide a slow release of macro- and micro-nutrients 
 improve soil structure by reducing compaction  
 enhance establishment of trees and shrubs in low-maintenance landscapes 
 enhance beneficial microbes, which can outcompete many pathogens in healthy soils 
 enhance soil macrofauna biodiversity 
Basic comparisons between inorganic and organic mulches 
Inorganic: 
 Good choice for regions where water is limited and organic matter is naturally low 
 Low replacement rate, but also does not contribute nutrients to the soil   
Organic: 
 Good choice for regions where water availability ensures optimal OM level (5-10%) 
 Decomposition requires continual replacement 

Problems with fine-textured mulches 
 Includes sawdust and some composts 
 Deep applications will lead to anaerobic soil conditions  
 Often become compacted into impervious layers 
 
Problems with compost 
 Possibility of toxic plant materials or byproducts 
 If too much of a nutrient source is added to a landscape, excess nutrients contaminate 
watersheds.  Phosphate in particular requires monitoring. 
 Contamination with broadleaf herbicides can injure or kill ornamentals 
 Unregulated compost can contain pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxins that may 
be harmful to you and your plants (e.g. mercury accumulations in golf course turf) 
Using compost as a mulch 
 Choose those that have been analyzed and certified, or that you make yourself with 
contaminant-free materials 
 Use thin layers to reduce problems associated with fine-textured mulches and with 
nutrient overload 
 Cover the compost layer with a coarser organic mulch to prevent erosion and weed 
establishment (the “mulch sandwich”) 
 
Problems with coarse woody mulches 
Bark mulches 
 Bark mulch can be contaminated with salt or weed seeds  
 Bark contains waxes that prevent absorption and release of water in landscapes 
 Softwood bark mulches are often not “people friendly” due to tiny, sharp fibers 
Arborist wood chips 
 Concerns about high carbon:nitrogen ratio – will this cause a nitrogen deficiency? 
 Will diseased wood transfer pathogens if it is used for chips? 
Nitrogen availability 
 Wood chip mulches have a high C:N ratio, leading to a localized nitrogen deficiency at 
the mulch-soil interface 
 Wood chip mulches do not cause nitrogen deficiency in established plants 
 High C:N ratio in wood chips probably prevents germination of some weed seeds 
Fungal pathogens and wood chips 
 Armillaria, Cytospora, Thyronectria and Verticillium can all survive on large wood 
segments for months 
 Survival is enhanced if wood chips are incorporated into soil 
 No evidence that pathogens in mulch can infect roots below the soil surface 
Fungal communities in wood chips 
 Fungal species in wood chips are generally decomposers, not pathogens 
 In healthy (aerobic) soils, beneficial fungi probably out-compete pathogenic fungi 
 Healthy plants are not susceptible to opportunistic pathogens  
 

Wood chip mulches for landscapes 
Weed suppression by wood chips 
 Highly effective – better than herbicides 
 Cost-effective – low to no cost materials 
 
How do wood chips inhibit weeds? 
 Inhibit weeds through allelopathic chemicals 
 Decrease nitrogen levels at soil interface 
 Reduce light needed by photodormant seeds 
 Reduce light availability to buried leaves 
 Depth is critical – less than 3” and weed increase 
 
Mulch strategies using coarse organic materials 
 Fresh wood chips have the highest nutrient content 
 Begin mulch application before annual weeds are established (spring or fall) 
 Remove perennial weeds in early spring when root resources are lowest 
 Prune or mow perennial weeds at root crown; pulling destroys soil structure 
 Remove all noxious weed materials from site to prevent rerooting 
 Thick layers (6-8” for ornamental sites, 8-12” for restoration sites and blackberry/ivy 
control) of coarse materials are best for weed control and water conservation 
 Keep mulch away from trunks of trees and shrubs 
 Pull any resprouting plants; the mulch layer prevents erosion and facilitates pulling 
 Replace mulch as needed to maintain appropriate depth (minimum depth of 4 inches for 
weed control).  This depends on decomposition rate

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) For Home Gardens 
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a science-based approach to managing pests using a 
variety of safe, sustainable, and effective tactics. In this context, pests are organisms that 
damage desirable plants or impact human or animal health. Pests may transmit disease or may 
be just a nuisance. A pest can be a plant (weed), vertebrate (bird, rodent, or other mammal), 
invertebrate (insect, tick, mite, or snail), nematode or pathogen (bacteria, virus, or fungus) that 
causes disease. However, there is no universal definition for pest. Clover may be a pest to the 
gardener seeking a ‘perfect’ lawn while valued for its nitrogen-fixing contributions to the owner 
of an eco-lawn. 
 
IPM focuses on the long-term prevention of pests or their damages by managing the garden 
environment. It uses an overall strategy that goes beyond controlling one type of pest. 
 
While each pest situation is different, five major components are common to all IPM programs: 
 
1. Identifying Pest  
Correctly identifying the pest is key to knowing whether a pest is likely to become a problem 
so you can determine the best management strategy. Learn about the pest, its biology, and 
environmental factors that affect it. Oregon gardeners may use this resource:

2. Monitoring and assessing pest numbers and damage 
Monitoring means checking your landscape for pests. The purpose of monitoring is twofold: 
1. You can catch pest problems in their earliest stages, when they are easiest to solve.  
2. You can gather information that will help you time your management actions when they 
will be most effective.  
Sticky traps, pit fall traps with soapy water, or pheromone traps will help you determine the 
number of pests present. 
 
2. Setting a threshold for when management action is needed 
Determine what level of damage is acceptable to you. A few holes in some leaves may be 
acceptable, but if pest damage has skeletonized the leaves, then action may be required. If 
the problem warrants control, select the most effective management methods and the best 
time to use them. If the damage is not bothersome to you, letting the problem play out for 
the season is a viable management strategy.   
 
3. Using a combination of biological, cultural, physical, and chemical management tools  
Biological Controls are the use of beneficial insects, also called natural enemies, to reduce 
insect pest numbers. You can attract beneficial insects to your garden with food such as 
 

nectar and pollen provided by plants. Water and nesting sites are also key to providing 
beneficial insects with a habitat. You can purchase predatory mites or the eggs of green lace 
wings. They will stay close to where they are released if food is available. Avoid using any 
insecticides that may harm them.

Cultural Controls are practices that emphasize modifying the natural environment to reduce 
the potential for pest problems. Examples include optimizing plant health by giving them 
proper plant care and choosing plant varieties that are resistant to insect damage.    
 
Physical Controls remove or block a pest from your plants. It is best to use these controls 
when pest populations are low. Examples include using insect traps, spraying plants with 
water to dislodge pests, and using barriers such as row covers or nets. 
You can also control pests that build nests or feed in aggregations with physical removal.  
Pruning out the branches containing tents made by web building caterpillars, or sawflies 
that feed in groups on isolated branches of a plant, can reduce pest populations and 
damage. This strategy works best in early stages of infestation. 
 
Chemical Controls can be used after other options have been exhausted. Many pesticides kill 
natural enemies along with the pest, and pest populations tend to rebound more quickly 
than their natural enemies.  
Consider the use of insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils before selecting more toxic 
methods.     
Understanding the pest’s life cycle and knowing where the pest is living and feeding is vital 
for successful chemical control. Proper placement, timing and effective application methods 
will save time and money and more effectively control the pest. For help with pesticide 
selection, contact your local Extension office.    
 
4. Assessing the result after action is taken 
Did the steps you employed work effectively? What would you do differently?

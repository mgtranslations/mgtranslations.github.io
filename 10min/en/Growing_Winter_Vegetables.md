Growing Winter Vegetables 
 
Benefits of Growing Your Own 
As sustainability and self-sufficiency gain popularity, so does home gardening. Personal 
satisfaction, access to varieties, and economics are also among the many reasons for growing 
your own vegetables.   
 
What to Plant 
West of the Cascades, there are many vegetables that can be planted in summer to harvest in 
fall or winter and some that can be left in the ground to overwinter for an early spring crop. 
• Cole crops – broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower 
• Root vegetables – beets, carrots, kohlrabi, radish, rutabaga, turnip 
• Greens – collard, kale, lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard 
• Legumes – peas, fava beans 
• Overwintering vegetables – Brassicas, root vegetables 
  
When to Plant 
It is important to know the first frost date for your area. Consult planting guides with times to 
plant seeds and transplants. Plant most vegetables in July, August and September for fall, 
winter, and spring harvests; plant garlic and shallots in October for harvesting the following 
summer. 
 
How to Plant 
Source 
Vegetables can be directly sown from seed or transplanted from starts. Use plants that are 
specifically designated for fall planting.  
Location 
Choose a site that gets six to eight hours of sunlight. Take advantage of structures such as 
south-facing walls or fences that reflect and hold heat longer. Raised beds, made with wood 
structures or made simply by mounding soil, heat up earlier in the spring and hold heat longer.  
Be sure that your site is protected from strong winds and that the soil has good drainage. 
Soil Preparation 
Next, prepare your soil by removing any rocks and weeds and amend the soil as needed. Clay 
soil can be improved by adding organic matter. If needed apply a low-nitrogen fertilizer to focus 
growth on roots and fruit, not on leaves. Do not use a high nitrogen fertilizer on crops in fall 
because it can stimulate late leaf growth which are susceptible to frost damage. Ensure your 
 

beds have at least 15 to18 inches of loose soil to allow adequate room for root growth and 
water distribution.  If your dry soil is too hard to dig, try soaking it in advance. 
   
Caring for Your New Plants 
If it’s hot and sunny when you plant, young plants will need extra care. Water transplants daily. 
You might need to sprinkle seeds and newly germinated seedlings twice a day so they don’t dry 
out.  
To keep the soil moist and protect young plants from the sun, temporarily shade them.  Boards 
and umbrellas make good shade structures.  
As cold weather approaches, mulch your plants with leaves or straw. Row covers, cloches, 
plastic tunnels, and cold frames make good season extenders.  
 
Harvesting Your Fall and Winter Garden 
Root vegetables such as turnips, beets and carrots are sweeter after a frost, which causes the 
plant to concentrate its sugars. These crops can be left in the ground and harvested throughout 
the winter. Lettuce and other salad greens will slow their growth during cold weather but can 
be hardy to 20° F with some protection.

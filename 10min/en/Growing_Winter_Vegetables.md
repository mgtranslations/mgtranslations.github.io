# Growing Winter Vegetables

### Benefits of Growing Your Own

As sustainability and self-sufficiency gain popularity, so does home gardening. Personal satisfaction, access to varieties, and economics are also among the many reasons for growing your own vegetables.

### What to Plant

West of the Cascades, there are many vegetables that can be planted in summer to harvest in fall or winter and some that can be left in the ground to overwinter for an early spring crop:

- **Cole crops** – broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower
- **Root vegetables** – beets, carrots, kohlrabi, radish, rutabaga, turnip
- **Greens** – collard, kale, lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard
- **Legumes** – peas, fava beans
- **Overwintering vegetables** – Brassicas, root vegetables

### When to Plant

It is important to know the first frost date for your area. Consult planting guides with times to plant seeds and transplants.

- Plant most vegetables in July, August, and September for fall, winter, and spring harvests.
- Plant garlic and shallots in October for harvesting the following summer.

### How to Plant


Vegetables can be directly sown from seed or transplanted from starts. Use plants that are specifically designated for fall planting.


Choose a site that gets six to eight hours of sunlight. Take advantage of structures such as south-facing walls or fences that reflect and hold heat longer. Raised beds, made with wood structures or simply by mounding soil, heat up earlier in the spring and hold heat longer.

Be sure that your site is protected from strong winds and that the soil has good drainage.


Prepare your soil by removing any rocks and weeds and amend the soil as needed.

- Improve clay soil by adding organic matter.
- Apply a low-nitrogen fertilizer to focus growth on roots and fruit, not on leaves. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers in fall, as they can stimulate late leaf growth susceptible to frost damage.

Ensure your beds have at least 15 to 18 inches of loose soil to allow adequate room for root growth and water distribution. If your dry soil is too hard to dig, try soaking it in advance.

### Caring for Your New Plants

If it’s hot and sunny when you plant, young plants will need extra care:

- Water transplants daily.
- Sprinkle seeds and newly germinated seedlings twice a day to prevent drying out.
- Temporarily shade young plants to keep the soil moist and protect them from the sun. Boards and umbrellas make good shade structures.

As cold weather approaches, mulch your plants with leaves or straw. Row covers, cloches, plastic tunnels, and cold frames make good season extenders.

### Harvesting Your Fall and Winter Garden

Root vegetables such as turnips, beets, and carrots are sweeter after a frost, which causes the plant to concentrate its sugars. These crops can be left in the ground and harvested throughout the winter.

Lettuce and other salad greens will slow their growth during cold weather but can be hardy to 20°F with some protection.

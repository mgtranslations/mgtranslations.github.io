How to Care for Houseplants 
Growing houseplants is a great way to add lush greenery to your home. Though some houseplants 
are nearly foolproof to grow, all plants need basic care. Plants thrive in an environment that closely 
resembles their native habitat. Before buying new plants, know their basic needs to determine 
whether you have the right place for them in your home and can provide proper care. 
 
Light: Light exposure is key to growing successful houseplants. Usually, you can rely on directional 
clues. A window facing south receives the most intense sun, west and east exposures rank in the 
middle, and a north-facing window is considered low light. Be careful not to put plants too close to or 
touching a window, where temperature variations and cold drafts can damage leaves. LED grow lights 
are an energy efficient way to add light. Heating vents and fireplaces should also be avoided. 
 
Placement: Houseplants need good airflow around them for good health and to minimize insect 
problems. Group houseplants according to light and temperature needs. Heating vents and fireplaces 
should be avoided. 
 
Watering: Water according to the needs of the individual plant. Check by sticking your finger into the 
soil, up to the second knuckle, to check for soil moisture. Or pick the pot up. If it’s light, the plant 
needs water. Be sure to use containers with drain holes in the bottom, or water will settle at the 
bottom and cause root rot. Over-watering kills more plants than under-watering. Be sure to water the 
soil, not the leaves. In winter, water plants lightly and only when the potting mix is dry. 
 
Humidity: Many houseplants are native to humid tropical rainforests, while others such as cacti and 
succulents originate in arid climates. Indoor air can be dry, particularly during winter months when 
heating systems are operating. Air that is too dry can result in shriveling, wilted, curling, yellow or 
brown foliage. Too much humidity can promote diseases. The optimal humidity range for most 
houseplants is 40-60 percent.  
 
Boost air humidity in one or more of the following ways: 
• Mist plant leaves regularly. 
• Place plants on a tray filled with pebbles and water. Make sure the bottom of the pot doesn’t 
sit in standing water. 
• Use a humidifier. 
• Place plants in a room with higher humidity such as a bathroom or kitchen.  
 
Containers: The size and type of container is crucial to houseplant health. Terracotta pots dry out 
fastest and are good for desert plants. A pot that is too large may lead to root rot, while a pot that is 
too small can restrict the uptake of water and nutrients. Start out with a container that is 1-2 inches 
larger than the root ball and gradually move up to a larger size. Make sure containers have adequate 
drainage holes in the bottom to allow excess water to drain through.  
 
 

Remove houseplants from containers annually to inspect roots. If roots are circling in the pot and 
tightly constricted, it’s time to transplant into a larger container. The best time to transplant is in the 
spring or summer when plants are actively growing, or trim up to a third of the roots to keep the 
plant the same size. 
 
Soil: Houseplants need a soil medium to grow in, though some houseplants such as air plants can 
grow without soil. Potting mixes are formulated for different types of plants. Most houseplants will 
thrive in all-purpose potting soil. Cacti and succulents prefer a leaner mix with more sand or perlite 
for better drainage. Orchids do best in a mix comprised of bark. For healthy plants, use fresh sterile 
potting mix to reduce the risk of diseases. 
 
Fertilizing: When plants are actively growing, feed in moderation with a slow-release fertilizer in 
granules, tablets or stakes. These usually last 2 to 3 months but can last longer depending on the 
product. Some brands have slow-release fertilizers that last six months. Alternatively, use a liquid 
version every other week according to directions. Plants do not need fertilizer when growth slows or 
stops, generally from November through March.  
 
Houseplants such as African violets and orchids need regular fertilizing in order to set flower buds. 
Others such as cacti and succulents do best with little or no fertilizer. Over-fertilizing can burn leaves 
or cause other damage, while a lack of nutrients may cause weak growth or stress. If you notice 
burning on the tips of leaves or a white crust on top of the potting soil, you’re most likely fertilizing 
too much. 
 
Clean leaves: Dust can accumulate on foliage, making it look dull and impeding a plant’s ability to 
absorb light through its leaves. Rinse off or wipe down leaves with a damp cloth to refresh.

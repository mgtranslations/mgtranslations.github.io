Common Diseases and Pests of Roses 
Roses can be a fragrant and lovely addition to any garden in the Pacific Northwest. However, 
they are known to be plagued by a few common diseases and pests. This handout provides 
monitoring and prevention strategies to ensure beautiful blooms and foliage throughout the 
summer.  
Black Spot 
• A fungus (Diplocarpon rosa) that occurs in spring and fall that causes brown to black 
spots with diffuse edges on leaves and stems. 
• Spores are spread by water during rainy periods.                   
• Purchase black spot resistant cultivars. 
• Remove leaves, stems, and flowers that show disease. 
• Water early in the day and avoid overhead watering. 
• Fungicides effectively control black spot when used according to label directions. 
Powdery Mildew 
• A fungus (Sphaerotheca pannosa) that covers the leaf and bud parts with a mat of white, 
powdery looking fungal filaments. 
• Prevalent during summer’s driest time when nighttime humidity is high. 
• Select disease resistant varieties. 
• Avoid overhead watering in the late afternoon or evening. 
• Remove any infected fallen leaves from the ground to prevent the spread of spores. 
• Provide roses with adequate air circulation and full sun.  
Rust 
• Rust is a fungal disease of the genus Phragmidium which begins in spring and peaks in 
early summer. 
• Appears as orange pustules on foliage. 
• Spores are carried by air and water onto new growth. 
• Remove all infected plant tissue throughout the season.        
• Prune roses to provide adequate air circulation. 
• Select disease resistant cultivars.                                                                   
 
 

Aphids 
• Aphids feed by piercing and sucking the sap from the leaves. 
• Aphids produce unattractive sticky black honeydew on leaves. 
• Monitor your roses frequently for early detection. 
• Hand pick or squish the aphids. 
• Hose aphids off the plant with a strong spray of water. 
• Apply Neem, horticultural oil, or insecticidal soaps. 
• Use a dormant season spray of horticultural soap to suffocate overwintering aphid eggs.                            
Rose Sawfly or Rose Slug 
• The common rose slug (Endelomyia aethiops) skeletonizes rose leaves in May or June.  
• The pale green larvae can be found feeding on the underside of the rose leaves. 
• The adults of the species are black thick waisted wasps. 
• Hand pick larvae and dispose of any infested leaves. Early detection is key. 
• Apply horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to the rose leaves.

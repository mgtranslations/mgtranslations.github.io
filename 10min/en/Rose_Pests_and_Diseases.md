# Common Diseases and Pests of Roses

Roses can be a fragrant and lovely addition to any garden in the Pacific Northwest. However, they are known to be plagued by a few common diseases and pests. This handout provides monitoring and prevention strategies to ensure beautiful blooms and foliage throughout the summer.

### Black Spot

- A fungus (*Diplocarpon rosa*) that occurs in spring and fall, causing brown to black spots with diffuse edges on leaves and stems.
- Spores are spread by water during rainy periods.
- Purchase black spot-resistant cultivars.
- Remove leaves, stems, and flowers that show disease.
- Water early in the day and avoid overhead watering.
- Fungicides effectively control black spot when used according to label directions.

### Powdery Mildew

- A fungus (*Sphaerotheca pannosa*) that covers the leaf and bud parts with a mat of white, powdery-looking fungal filaments.
- Prevalent during summer’s driest time when nighttime humidity is high.
- Select disease-resistant varieties.
- Avoid overhead watering in the late afternoon or evening.
- Remove any infected fallen leaves from the ground to prevent the spread of spores.
- Provide roses with adequate air circulation and full sun.

### Rust

- Rust is a fungal disease of the genus *Phragmidium*, which begins in spring and peaks in early summer.
- Appears as orange pustules on foliage.
- Spores are carried by air and water onto new growth.
- Remove all infected plant tissue throughout the season.
- Prune roses to provide adequate air circulation.
- Select disease-resistant cultivars.

### Aphids

- Aphids feed by piercing and sucking the sap from the leaves.
- Aphids produce unattractive sticky black honeydew on leaves.
- Monitor your roses frequently for early detection.
- Hand-pick or squish the aphids.
- Hose aphids off the plant with a strong spray of water.
- Apply Neem, horticultural oil, or insecticidal soaps.
- Use a dormant season spray of horticultural soap to suffocate overwintering aphid eggs.

### Rose Sawfly or Rose Slug

- The common rose slug (*Endelomyia aethiops*) skeletonizes rose leaves in May or June.
- The pale green larvae can be found feeding on the underside of the rose leaves.
- The adults of the species are black thick-waisted wasps.
- Hand-pick larvae and dispose of any infested leaves. Early detection is key.
- Apply horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to the rose leaves.

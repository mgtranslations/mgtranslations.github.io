Choosing the Right Tree for Your Home Garden 
 
Introduction 
Trees can provide many benefits -- beauty, enclosure, privacy, shade. They can also lower heating and 
cooling costs and increase property value. Trees house and feed wildlife and provide environmental 
benefits by absorbing carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen, and holding water in their root zone.  
 
How to Select a Tree 
Before buying a tree, assess potential locations. The longevity of trees requires careful studies of the site.  
Take care to make sure your location and the tree pair well. No impulse buying!  
 
Potential Location: Use the checklist in the section below. Because most urban gardens are constrained in 
space, conduct an honest assessment of potential conflicts as the tree grows to save future problems.  
 
Desired Benefits: Make a list of benefits you seek from the tree -- shade, beauty, foliage color, fruit, flower, 
privacy enclosure, wildlife values are common motivations. Since no one tree can offer all, it is helpful to 
think about tradeoffs and know your priorities.  
 
General Considerations: Place deciduous trees in the south/west to shade the summer sun; use conifers to 
block prevailing wind in the winter. When selecting a tree for the beauty of foliage, flowers and fruits, place 
it where the fallen leaves, petals and fruits will not be a bother.  
 
A Checklist for Siting a Tree  
Available Space: Estimate space above and below ground that can be available for the tree as it grows. 
Consult multiple sources for mature height and crown width of the candidate. Keep in mind that tree shape 
can change with maturity. Also size varies depending on soil and location. A good resource is the Oregon 
State University landscape plant database https://landscapeplants.oregonstate.edu/ 
 
Prevailing Wind Direction and Sun Exposure: Conifer or broadleaf evergreen trees can block prevailing wind 
and summer sun. If you want a tree for shade in the summer but allows sunlight to go through for the 
winter, choose a deciduous tree. Keep in mind that not all conifers are evergreen -- deciduous conifers 
include larch, bald cypress, dawn redwood. Also remember that not all broadleaf trees are deciduous -- 
evergreen broadleaf trees include Southern magnolia, holly, strawberry tree. 
 
Potential Conflicts: 
• With other plants – Consider the future reach of roots and shoots – imagine what the tree will look like 
in 20 years. Mature crowns may be rounded, vase-shape, reverse teardrop shape; visualize how it may 
affect other plants. Columnar and fastigiate specimens are better fit for narrow areas while weeping 
shapes form enclosures. Roots of mature trees are likely to reach beyond the dripline.  
• With utility wires and structures – Keep trees at least 3 feet from pavement, 15 feet from buildings and 
other trees, and if your tree will grow taller than 30 feet, 25 feet away from overhead electrical wires. 
 

 
 
Tall trees that reach 60 feet or more should be 35 feet away from the house for proper root 
development. 
 
Soil & Water: Roots need both air and water. Ideally the soil has good structure and allows air and water to 
flow through. Roots of mature trees reach wider than the span of its crown; give it a location that will not 
be surrounded by impermeable pavement.  
 
Desired Benefits: Trees offer beauty with their foliage, flowers, fruits, and bark. Some of these benefits 
come with unsightly debris. Place the tree where attractive features are best enjoyed while debris creates 
the least bother.

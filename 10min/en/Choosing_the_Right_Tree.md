# Choosing the Right Tree for Your Home Garden

### Introduction

Trees can provide many benefits—beauty, enclosure, privacy, shade. They can also lower heating and cooling costs and increase property value. Trees house and feed wildlife and provide environmental benefits by absorbing carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen, and holding water in their root zone.

### How to Select a Tree

Before buying a tree, assess potential locations. The longevity of trees requires careful studies of the site. Take care to make sure your location and the tree pair well. No impulse buying!


Use the checklist in the section below. Because most urban gardens are constrained in space, conduct an honest assessment of potential conflicts as the tree grows to save future problems.


Make a list of benefits you seek from the tree—shade, beauty, foliage color, fruit, flower, privacy enclosure, wildlife values are common motivations. Since no one tree can offer all, it is helpful to think about tradeoffs and know your priorities.


- Place deciduous trees in the south/west to shade the summer sun; use conifers to block prevailing wind in the winter.
- When selecting a tree for the beauty of foliage, flowers, and fruits, place it where the fallen leaves, petals, and fruits will not be a bother.

### A Checklist for Siting a Tree


Estimate space above and below ground that can be available for the tree as it grows. Consult multiple sources for mature height and crown width of the candidate. Keep in mind that tree shape can change with maturity. Also, size varies depending on soil and location. A good resource is the [Oregon State University landscape plant database](https://landscapeplants.oregonstate.edu/).


Conifer or broadleaf evergreen trees can block prevailing wind and summer sun. If you want a tree for shade in the summer but allows sunlight to go through for the winter, choose a deciduous tree.

- Not all conifers are evergreen—deciduous conifers include larch, bald cypress, dawn redwood.
- Not all broadleaf trees are deciduous—evergreen broadleaf trees include Southern magnolia, holly, strawberry tree.


- **With other plants**: Consider the future reach of roots and shoots—imagine what the tree will look like in 20 years. Mature crowns may be rounded, vase-shaped, or reverse teardrop-shaped; visualize how it may affect other plants. Columnar and fastigiate specimens are better fits for narrow areas, while weeping shapes form enclosures. Roots of mature trees are likely to reach beyond the dripline.
- **With utility wires and structures**: Keep trees at least 3 feet from pavement, 15 feet from buildings and other trees, and if your tree will grow taller than 30 feet, 25 feet away from overhead electrical wires.

Tall trees that reach 60 feet or more should be 35 feet away from the house for proper root development.


Roots need both air and water. Ideally, the soil has good structure and allows air and water to flow through. Roots of mature trees reach wider than the span of its crown; give it a location that will not be surrounded by impermeable pavement.


Trees offer beauty with their foliage, flowers, fruits, and bark. Some of these benefits come with unsightly debris. Place the tree where attractive features are best enjoyed while debris creates the least bother.

Lawn Care 
Introduction 
Understanding how home lawns naturally evolve is key to having a good-looking lawn while minimizing labor and 
chemical use.  To start, the home gardener needs to accept one reality -- new lawns seeded with grass, often 
perennial ryegrass and fine fescue, will gradually and naturally shift toward bentgrasses and annual bluegrasses. 
This process is the inevitable result of seeds carried in by wind or those already present in your soil “seed bank” 
when the lawn was installed.  The end product, a “climax lawn”, is perfectly adapted to your site. If the home 
gardener follows care instructions in this handout, a climax lawn can look lush, healthy and inviting. 
 
Mowing 
Mowing is central to managing the home lawn. Proper mowing requires setting the mower at the correct height 
and mowing at the recommended frequency: Mow high, and mow often! 
• Frequency -- Mow at-least weekly March through October and once a month the rest of the year. Lawns 
allowed to become dormant during the summer do not need regular mowing. 
• Mowing height - Set the mowing height according to the dominant type of turf grass: 1-1.5” for colonial bent 
grass; 1.5-2.5” for fine fescue, perennial rye and Kentucky blue; 2-3” for tall fescue. If you are not sure what you 
have, set the mowing height to 2”.  
• Grass clippings – Use a mulching mower to return clippings to the lawn. This reduces the need for added 
nitrogen fertilizer. Ideally, clippings should form a finely-cut, light covering. Clumping, wet clippings should be 
broken up and mowed a second time or raked up and deposited into the compost bin.   
• Mower blades – Keep them sharp so grass is cut clean and not torn.  
• Compaction – Foot traffic and mower wheels compact soil. Change mowing pattern to lessen impact. 
 
Fertilizing 
A healthy lawn needs to be fed preferably 2 to 4 times a year. Fertilizer improves vigor and health of the turf grass 
so they can outcompete weeds.  
• Needs by type of grass – Perennial ryegrass has the highest need for nitrogen; tall fescue is intermediate; and 
fine fescues and bentgrasses do well at low levels of nitrogen. 
• Frequency – The type of dominant turf grass determines frequency; perennial rye needs 2 to 4 applications of 
nitrogen per year, tall fescue and fine fescue need 1 to 3 applications per year, and climax lawn should be 
fertilized 2 applications per year.  
• Timing – If you fertilize twice a year, do so once in mid-May and then again sometime between mid-September 
to mid-October. If you fertilizer 4 times annually make the first applications in April, the second application 
sometime in May-June, the third application sometime in August-September, and the final application in 
October. 
• Fertilizer content (N-P-K) – Lawn fertilizers should be high in nitrogen (N) and low in phosphorus (P) and 
potassium (K). In our area, P tends not to be deficient so, unless a soil analysis indicates a need, add products 
containing N and K only.   
• When purchasing a fertilizer look for products with an equal proportion of water soluble (quick release) and 
water insoluble (slow release) sources of N, which will be noted on the fertilizer content label.    
• Water-soluble proportions of N give immediate results, while slow release forms act over time. Therefore, 
products containing both of these nitrogen sources will provide a relatively even growth.   
• If you choose to apply purely water-soluble N sources, such as urea and ammonium nitrate, apply at low rates 
(0.5 pounds N per 1,000 square feet) and repeat often; what is not immediately absorbed by plants or soil 
microbes will be lost.  If you want organic lawn fertilizer, feather meal or corn gluten meal are effective sources 
of nitrogen; organic fertilizers are examples of slow release products.     
 

• Apply fertilizer at 0.5 to 1.5 pounds of N per 1,000 square feet, depending on turf health.  Lush lawns can do 
with the low end while thin, yellowing turf should receive the high end.  
• Adjust fertilizer rates according to the labeled N concentration. For examples if the fertilizer is 20% nitrogen 
(e.g., 20-x-y labeled on the package), you will apply 5 pounds of the fertilizer to get 1 pound of N.  
 
Watering 
Shorter, more frequent irrigation is the way to go. Clay soil needs shorter, more frequent sessions to wet the root 
zone while avoiding run-off, while sandier soils need short, frequent irrigation to replace the small amounts of 
water it can hold. Evaporation is another major factor affecting watering: Water more when the weather is hot.  
• Seasonal variations – Because home irrigation supplements rain, irrigation needs change with precipitation.   
Turn off your irrigation system during the winter. 
• How often – In the spring/early summer when temperatures are still moderate, and evaporation is minimal 
apply ¼” two to three times a week (equating to ½ to ¾ inch per week).  Add irrigation days or events as 
temperatures and the demand for water increase.  Use empty tuna cans or rain gauges to measure irrigation 
depth, targeting ¼” per event.  
• During peak periods of peak drought in the Willamette Valley, lawns should get 1 to 1 ½” water added weekly.  
• Tips – Between irrigation events, check the moisture content by inserting a screwdriver into the turf; if the soil 
is hard and dry add more irrigation events to your program. Water early in the day to minimize loss to 
evaporation.  
• Water conservation – You can let the lawn go brown during the summer; most turf grass will survive and green 
up again with the arrival of fall rain. Persistent drought can kill shallow roots and subject the turf to weed 
invasion. A thorough watering session once a month will minimize root damage and speed up recovery in fall.  
 
Weeding 
Be vigilant with removing large weeds with tap roots, such as dandelions, and consider tolerating small ones such 
as clover and English daisy.  If you have weeds in the lawn, remove them by hand or spot apply broadleaf 
herbicides. Fill in any bare spot with some compost and over seed, if seed is not applied these spots will only 
become weeds again. This approach saves time, money, and minimizes unnecessary use of chemicals.  
 
Dethatching 
Thatch is a tight layer of grass stems and roots, some living and some dead, that form between the soil surface and 
green blades. Thatch should be removed with a steel hand rake when turf is just beginning vigorous growth in the 
spring.  Left alone, grass roots will grow in this thick layer of thatch, which dries out quicker than soil, and induces 
drought stress in your lawn.

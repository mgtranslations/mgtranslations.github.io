# Growing Tomatoes in the Home Garden

## Deciding Which Varieties to Grow

- Determine intended uses – eating fresh, drying, canning, or making sauce.
- Assess available garden space – how many plants and which type.
- Choose between starting from seeds or purchasing plants.
- Know if determinate or indeterminate tomatoes will work best for your garden.

#### Type of Tomato

| Type         | Space / Support Requirements     | Growth Habit    | Harvest                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Determinate  | Less / can do with less support  | Bushy           | Fruits ripen about the same time |
| Indeterminate| More / need sturdy support       | Keeps growing   | Fruits ripen over a long season  |

## Starting from Seeds

Starting from seeds offers more variety and lower cost than potted plants, and it provides the joy of watching them grow.

1. **Germinate Seeds**
   - Begin in early March (8 weeks before the last frost, May 1–10).
   - Place moist seedling mix in small pots (1–1.5”), firm the soil, drop in one seed, and cover with 1/4” peat or starter mix.
   - Keep starts warm (65–70°F) using a bottom heat mat and cover to prevent drying.
   - Seeds should germinate in 6–10 days. Provide ample light for growth.

2. **Repot Seedlings**
   - Repot into 3–4” pots at the second set of true leaves using moist seedling mix.
   - Steps for repotting:
     1. Hydrate seedling mix.
     2. Water plant thoroughly with room-temperature water.
     3. Handle seedlings by leaves, not the stem.
     4. Place the plant deeper in the new pot (tomato plants grow roots along the buried stem).
     5. Firm soil around the plant, leaving ½” at the top.
     6. Water to ensure good contact between roots and soil mix.
     7. Place in a warm, sunny location (8+ hours of sun), away from wind.

3. **Second Repotting**
   - Repot into a gallon-sized pot when the plant is 6–10” tall.
   - Steps:
     1. Hydrate potting soil.
     2. Hydrate the plant by floating the pot in a bucket of water until bubbling stops and the pot sinks.
     3. Remove/pinch off leaves that will touch or be below the soil level.
     4. Gently remove the plant from the pot and follow steps 4–7 above.
   - Protect plants from cold using water-filled milk jugs, fabric/plastic coverings, or placing them near a wall or fence.
   - Harden off plants after the first repotting at 3”. Start with a couple of hours in the shade and gradually increase exposure to full sun over 7–10 days.

## Planting into the Ground

Plants are ready for the ground when they are 10–15” tall and soil temperature reaches 60°F (in June).

### Preparation and Planting Steps

1. Select a site with 8+ hours of sun, loamy soil, and little wind (avoid low areas where water and cold air settle).
2. Work soil 10” deep by turning with a shovel.
3. Add 2” of compost and mix well.
4. Hydrate the plant 1–2 hours before transplanting using the bucket method.
5. Prune lower leaves and suckers (side shoots where a mature leaf joins the stem) below the first blooms.
6. Choose a planting method:

#### Trench Method

- **Pros:** Roots are in the warmest soil; good for leggy plants.
- **Cons:** Requires frequent watering and careful, shallow cultivation.
- Steps:
  - Dig a trench 8–10” deep.
  - Add fertilizer and lime (based on soil test) to the bottom.
  - Cover amendments with 1–2” soil to prevent burning roots.
  - Lay the plant on its side, fill the hole with soil, water, and mound dirt around the stem.
  - Place a marker at the root ball end to avoid root damage during weeding.
  - Add support structure at planting to prevent root damage.

#### Vertical Method

- **Pros:** Larger reservoir of moisture available to roots; less cracking.
- **Cons:** Deeper soil is cooler, causing slower growth and fruit ripening.
- Steps:
  - Dig a 10” deep hole.
  - Add fertilizer and lime, cover as with the Trench Method.
  - Place the plant deeper to promote buried stem root growth.
  - Fill soil to ground level, water, and add support structure.

## Cultural Practices

- **Support:**
  - Support both determinate and indeterminate tomato types to improve air movement and discourage diseases and pests.
  - Tomato supports include hoop-style cages, lattices, stakes, and concrete reinforcing wire. Anchor supports with 2”x2” stakes for stability.

- **Mulch:**
  - Mulch minimizes weeds, retains soil moisture, and prevents soil-borne diseases.
  - Plastic mulch (clear, black, or red) warms the soil and can be placed before or at planting.
  - Organic mulch improves soil but should be placed after the soil warms in late June.

- **Pruning:**
  - Prune indeterminate plants to ripen fruit and prevent disease.
  - Decide how many main stems the plant will have and allow only selected side shoots to develop.
  - Thin the plant to improve visibility and airflow as it grows.

## Other Tips

- **Flea Beetle Damage:** Fertilize for stronger growth if young plants show small holes in leaves. No further treatment is usually needed for strong plants.
- **Watering:** In dry or hot weather, soak the soil with at least 1” of water every 7–10 days.
- **Promoting Ripening:**
  - 30 days before the first frost (August/September), stop watering, remove new blossoms, and immature tomatoes that won’t ripen before frost.
  - Cover the plant with plastic to protect from rain and cooler temperatures or harvest larger green tomatoes. Place them in a single layer (not touching) in a warm (65–70°F), dark location to ripen indoors.
- **End-of-Season Cleanup:** Remove all plant debris to reduce future pests and diseases.
- **Crop Rotation:** Wait 3–4 years before planting tomato family members (tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, and potatoes) in the same spot.

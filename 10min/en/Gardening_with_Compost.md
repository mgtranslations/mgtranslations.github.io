Gardening with Compost 
Compost is an excellent mulch when placed on top of soil. It is a source of fertilizer and a soil conditioner 
when it is worked into the soil.  Following the steps in this handout, a home gardener can turn grass clippings, 
leaves, and other yard debris into compost for home use. 
 
Recipe for Success    
Your compost pile is a teeming community of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa) and others 
(centipedes, millipedes, beetles and worms) that “process” yard debris.  To provide essential nutrients for the 
microorganisms, mix two parts carbon-rich (“brown”) materials to one part nitrogen-rich (“green”) materials 
as you build your pile.  A pile with these proportions of carbon to nitrogen will promote large populations of 
microorganisms and produce compost quickly.  Other proportions of brown to green will create good compost 
but will decompose more slowly. 
 
Green (one part) Brown (two parts) 
• Fresh grass clippings 
• Green leaves 
• Plant stalks 
• Hedge trimmings 
• Annual weeds without seed heads 
• Vegetable and fruit scraps 
• Coffee filters and tea bags 
• Old potting soil 
• Twigs 
• Dried grass and leaves 
• Shredded newspaper 
• Straw 
• Wood chips 
 
 
Do not compost diseased plants; weeds with seed heads; invasive weeds such as quack grass and morning 
glory; the roots of perennial weeds; pet wastes; dead animals; bread and grains; meat or fish parts; dairy 
products; grease, cooking oil or oily foods. Grease, meat and dairy will smell bad and attract pests. Pet waste 
can spread disease. Weeds may spread to other gardens. Consider using a worm compost bin for your kitchen 
scraps.  
To avoid herbicide problems:  Use few or no herbicides.  The warm temperatures in a compost pile accelerate 
herbicide breakdown to nontoxic compounds.  Binding with organic matter in the compost also inactivates 
herbicides.  Let your compost sit for a year or more before using it to allow nearly complete breakdown of 
herbicides. 
 
Building a Compost Pile 
• Chop it Small:  If the microorganisms have more surface area to feed on, the materials will break down 
faster.  Chop your garden debris with a machete, or use a chipper/shredder or lawnmower to shred 
materials.   
• Size Matters: Compost piles trap heat generated by the activity of millions of microorganisms.  A 3-foot by 
3-foot by 3-foot compost pile is considered a minimum size for hot, fast composting.  Piles wider or taller 
than 5 feet don’t allow enough air to reach the microorganisms at the center. 
• Air and Water: Most life on earth needs a certain amount of water and air to survive.  Microorganisms in 
the compost pile work best when the pile is as damp as a wrung-out sponge and has many air passages.  
Extremes of sun or rain can adversely affect the balance of air and moisture in your pile.  The air in the pile 
is used up faster than the water, so the pile must be “turned” or mixed up regularly to add air that will 
promote high temperatures and control odors.   
 

• Time and Temperature: Decomposing bacteria thrive in temperatures between 110  ̊F - 160  ̊F.  The hotter 
the pile, the faster they work.  If you achieve a good balance of carbon and nitrogen, provide lots of 
surface area within a large volume of material, and maintain adequate moisture and aeration, the 
temperature will rise over several days. 
 
Uses for Compost    
• To amend soil: Mix two to five inches of compost into vegetable and flower gardens each year before 
planting. 
• To make potting mix: Add one part compost to two parts commercial potting soil, or make your own with   
equal parts of compost and sand or perlite. 
• To top-dress a lawn: Top-dressing turf areas with compost is recommended to provide a slow release of 
nitrogen.  Mix finely sifted compost with sand and sprinkle evenly over the lawn.  Using compost also will 
improve the condition of your soil and increase water retention, thus saving water. 
 
Potential Problems and Solutions  
• Compost pile does not heat up. 
                  Possible causes        Potential solutions 
Too wet:  compost materials are soggy.                                 Turn the pile, adding dry, absorbent material such as sawdust, straw or 
wood chips. 
Too dry  Water with hose; moisten pile without saturating it. 
Not enough nitrogen:  compost pile is too small; 
the heap is damp; it’s warm only in the center.    
Turn the pile, adding nitrogen-rich material (manure, grass clippings). Mix 
in to form a new pile; moisten. 
Material may be finished composting.                                     Finished compost is dark and crumbly with an earthy smell. 
          
• Compost pile smells like rotten eggs. 
Too wet/not enough oxygen:  compost pile is 
putrefying, not decomposing.                                                    
Turn the pile to aerate, adding dry, absorbent material such as sawdust, 
straw, wood chips. 
 
• Compost pile has ammonia odor. 
Too much nitrogen:  excess nitrogen is released to 
the atmosphere in the form of ammonia gas.                  
Turn the pile, adding sawdust or other carbon source. Goal is to keep 
nitrogen in the pile. 
Too alkaline:  the loss of nitrogen in the form of 
ammonia increases when the pile is very    alkaline 
(high pH).  Adding too much limestone to 
the heap will make it alkaline. 
Turn the pile, adding acid material such as sawdust, oak leaves, vegetable 
scraps. 
 
Too wet/not enough oxygen Turn the pile, adding dry, absorbent material such as sawdust, straw, wood 
chips. 
 
• Pests (rats, raccoons, insects) 
Presence of meat or fatty food scraps Remove meat/fatty goods from the pile.  Turn it to increase temperature 
and to balance carbon-to-nitrogen ratio; use animal-proof compost bin.

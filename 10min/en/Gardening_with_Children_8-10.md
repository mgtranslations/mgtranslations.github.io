# Gardening with Children Ages 8-10

### Why Garden with Children?

- They can experience the cycle of life first-hand.
- It will teach them responsibility and foster creativity.
- It will give them an understanding of our dependence on nature and its abundance.

Gardening with children ages 8 to 10 can be particularly rewarding since they have more independence and enjoy working with adults on important projects. It gets them outside and connects them with nature. They can ask questions, explore, learn cause and effect, and gain skills in planning and problem-solving.

### Ideas to Consider

- Give them their own space, whether a raised bed, pots, or ground plots. Each child should have their own space.
- Keep it small because a smaller space is more manageable and everything seems larger through a child’s eyes. Start small and increase size with their increasing age and interest.
- Place their garden in the best possible spot with adequate sun and a water source.
- Use serious work tools. Do not give them plastic tools that may break and make a new gardener frustrated.

### Some Activities

Children in this age group will have ideas about the kinds of things they would like to grow and nurture, so allow them to plan their garden. They will need reminders to carefully read the seed packets for germination times, spacing, and days until harvest. Sometimes trial and error can be a great teacher of how and when to grow in your garden space.

#### Improve Garden Soil Before Growing Vegetables

Adding composted chicken or steer manure in a designated garden bed will help children understand the importance of nitrogen in the garden and how using animal manure is a good way to recycle waste while helping plants grow. They may say it’s “icky” and “disgusting,” but they should be encouraged to be scientists.

#### Build a Worm Bin

Worm bins can be constructed out of many different materials and can be as large or as small as desired. When building a worm bin, you need to think about a container, bedding, oxygen, and food. You will be creating a decomposing micro-ecosystem. Consider a material that can best handle the decomposition process, moisture, and potential heat and cold throughout the year.

#### Planting Corn and Sunflowers

Planting teaches children the depth for sowing seeds of different sizes and the separation needed to give plants enough space to grow. Questions to consider:

- How long will it take for them to germinate?
- How tall will they grow?
- Have they placed them in an appropriate spot in the garden?
- Should the seeds be soaked before planting to decrease the germination period?

[Growing Your Own](https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/em9027) offers “how-to” information on a wide variety of plants.

#### Plant for Pollinators

Begin by observing which pollinators frequent your garden. Do you have bees, butterflies, hummingbirds? What color flowers do pollinators prefer, such as red, purple, pink, white, and yellow?

Suggestions:

- Honeysuckle, salvia, and bean plants for hummingbirds.
- Milkweed for monarch butterflies.
- Herbs that attract pollinators: anise hyssop, basil, catnip, chives, cilantro, dill, fennel, and lavender.

### Add Literacy

There are many wonderful picture and instructional books about gardening that children appreciate before they begin and while they are working in the garden. Reading aloud to them invites questioning and can be a springboard for garden plans. Your local librarian can help you find resources that both you and your child will enjoy.

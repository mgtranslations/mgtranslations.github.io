Space Considerations for Placing a Tree
•Estimate available space above and below ground 
•Estimate thefuture reach of roots and shoots 
•Consult multiple sources for mature height and width

Tree Forms @ Maturity
Tree shape can change with maturity

Do Tree Roots Attack Sewer Pipes?
•Choose smaller trees if conflict with sewer pipe is of concern
•Larger trees have more extensive roots --trees named as having ‘aggressive’ roots --
Willow, Ash, Poplar, Cottonwood, Sweet Gum, Sycamore, some Maple (Norway, 
Silver, Boxelder, Red) 
•Roots go where there is water and air --penetrate cracks or weak joints in sewer pipes
•Concrete borders forces roots to go above ground or deeper

Wire & Structure Issues for Placing a Tree
USDA Tree Owners Manual www.treeownersmanual.info
•Keep trees at least 3 feet from pavement, 15 feet from buildings and other trees
•If the tree will grow taller than 30 feet, plant it 25 feet away from overhead wires 
•Tall trees that reach 60 feet or more should be at least 35 feet away from the house for 
proper root development
International Society of Arboriculturewww.isa-arbor.com
•Treesplaced within 15 feet of utility wires should not exceed 20 feet high at maturity

Soil & Water Issues in Placing a Tree
•Roots need both air and water 
•Healthy soil allows air and water to flow through, compacted soil does not 
•Locate trees where roots won’t be covered by pavement or concrete
•Have a source of irrigation
•Water the root zone during establishment (first 3 years)
•Some mature trees need water during drought
•Lawn and tree seldom have the same watering need
•Some trees, such as cypress & native oaks, don’t like summer water

Using Trees as Windbreak or for Shade 
•Consider using conifer or broadleaf evergreen trees toblock 
prevailing wind
•Use tree canopies to shade summer sun
•Use a deciduous tree for summer shade if you wish sunlight to 
shinethrough in the winter

Buying a Tree: Larger ≠ Faster
•Normal growth resumes when a transplanted tree reaches a shoot/root ratio that 
is comparable to non-transplanted trees 
•Smaller transplanted trees resume growth sooner 
•Larger transplanted trees require much longer
•After transplant, trees grow slowly for many years during which time roots slowly 
reach non-transplanted tree size
Influence of Tree Size on Transplant Establishment and Growth, HortTechnology 
https://journals.ashs.org/horttech/view/journals/horttech/15/1/article-p118.xml

•Size of the hole –same depth as the root system, at least twice its width, shaped like 
a shallow bowl or with straight sides
•Remove roots and large rocks from this hole
•Break up the excavated soil 
•Mound native soil in the center  
•Place roots over the mound and spread outward like a starfish
•Check the crown to ensure it is ABOVE the soil level 
•Fill the hole with soil and water well
Planting 
Planting Tips Based on Horticultural Research
https://cmastergardeners.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/planting-tips.pdf

Don’t Plant Too Deep
Root Flare

Stake only if necessary 
Top-heavy plant
Windy location
Drive a pair of stakes into ground before planting to avoid damaging roots
Tie low (lower one-third of trunk)
Loose enough to allow ‘wiggle’
Use materials that will not damage bark
Stake no longer than one year
Don’t Stake Too Long / Too Tight / Too High

•Water frequently if planting in warm season
•Fall planting needs less supplemental watering
•Hydrate before freeze
•Evergreen conifers use water even in winter
•Water the root zone during establishment (first 3 years)
•Per week, 2 gallons per inch of trunk caliper
•Roots reach wider than the span of the crown
•Moisten the root zonew a slow trickle of water 
Drip line / soaker hose  OR
Drill holes in the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket, place over root zone then fill
Do Water Well

4” arborist’s wood chips on top of soil (research shows up to 12” is OK)
Fresh is better than composted --feeds fungi and enriches soil microbiology
Do not mix into soil
Cover the entire root zone 
Feathered to trunk
Do Use Mulch

## Space Considerations for Placing a Tree

- Estimate available space above and below ground.
- Estimate the future reach of roots and shoots.
- Consult multiple sources for mature height and width:
  - [OSU Landscape Plant Database](https://landscapeplants.oregonstate.edu)
  - *The Tree Book*, Michael Dirr & Keith Warren, Timber Press, 2019
  - *Trees to Know in Oregon and Washington*, Edward Jensen, OSU Extension Publication EC1450, [https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu](https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu)
- Keep in mind that size varies depending on soil and location.

## Do Tree Roots Attack Sewer Pipes?

- Choose smaller trees if conflict with sewer pipes is a concern.
- Larger trees have more extensive roots; trees named as having ‘aggressive’ roots include:
  - Willow, Ash, Poplar, Cottonwood, Sweet Gum, Sycamore, some Maple (Norway, Silver, Boxelder, Red).
- Roots go where there is water and air, penetrating cracks or weak joints in sewer pipes.
- Concrete borders force roots to go above ground or deeper.

## Wire & Structure Issues for Placing a Tree

- **USDA Tree Owners Manual**: [www.treeownersmanual.info](https://www.treeownersmanual.info)
  - Keep trees at least 3 feet from pavement, 15 feet from buildings and other trees.
  - If the tree will grow taller than 30 feet, plant it 25 feet away from overhead wires.
  - Tall trees that reach 60 feet or more should be at least 35 feet away from the house for proper root development.
- **International Society of Arboriculture**: [www.isa-arbor.com](https://www.isa-arbor.com)
  - Trees placed within 15 feet of utility wires should not exceed 20 feet high at maturity.

---

## Soil & Water Issues in Placing a Tree

- Roots need both air and water.
- Healthy soil allows air and water to flow through; compacted soil does not.
- Locate trees where roots won’t be covered by pavement or concrete.
- Have a source of irrigation.
- Water the root zone during establishment (first 3 years).
- Some mature trees need water during drought.
- Lawn and tree seldom have the same watering needs.
- Some trees, such as cypress and native oaks, don’t like summer water.

---

## Using Trees as Windbreak or for Shade

- Consider using conifer or broadleaf evergreen trees to block prevailing wind.
- Use tree canopies to shade summer sun.
- Use a deciduous tree for summer shade if you wish sunlight to shine through in the winter.

## Buying a Tree: Larger ≠ Faster

- Normal growth resumes when a transplanted tree reaches a shoot/root ratio comparable to non-transplanted trees.
- Smaller transplanted trees resume growth sooner.
- Larger transplanted trees require much longer.
- After transplant, trees grow slowly for many years during which time roots slowly reach non-transplanted tree size.

## Planting Tips

### Don’t Plant Too Deep

- Ensure the root flare is above the soil level.

### Stake Only If Necessary

- Top-heavy plant or windy location.
- Drive a pair of stakes into the ground before planting to avoid damaging roots.
- Tie low (lower one-third of trunk), loose enough to allow ‘wiggle’.
- Use materials that will not damage bark.
- Stake no longer than one year.

### Do Water Well

- Water frequently if planting in warm season.
- Fall planting needs less supplemental watering.
- Hydrate before freeze.
- Evergreen conifers use water even in winter.
- Water the root zone during establishment (first 3 years).
- Per week, 2 gallons per inch of trunk caliper.
- Roots reach wider than the span of the crown.
- Moisten the root zone with a slow trickle of water:
  - Drip line / soaker hose OR
  - Drill holes in the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket, place over root zone, then fill.

### Do Use Mulch

- 4” arborist’s wood chips on top of soil (research shows up to 12” is OK).
- Fresh is better than composted—feeds fungi and enriches soil microbiology.
- Do not mix into soil.
- Cover the entire root zone, feathered to trunk.

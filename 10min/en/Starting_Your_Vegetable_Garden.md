Starting Your Vegetable Garden 
 
What to Grow 
Begin with what you like to eat, high-cost crops (herbs, for example) and short-season crops. If you eat 
salads, try sowing some lettuce seeds that matures in 40-50 days for early success. Expand your palette over 
time. 
 
Space & Location 
Start small.  A 2-foot diameter by 18-inch deep container can work for leafy greens. Beginners may try a 10-
foot by 10-foot plot. A well-tended garden produces many times more than a neglected one. A 30-foot by 
30-foot garden will yield enough fresh produce for a family of 4. 
Find a sunny location.  8 hours of sun is crucial to plants that bear fruit (tomato, cucumber, squash, eggplant, 
peppers, and melon); leafy vegetables (lettuce and spinach) tolerate partial shade. 
Choose or make a high spot.  Low areas tend to have drainage problems. Cold air settles in low spots and 
shortens the growing season. To remedy, consider making raised beds; it improves drainage and warms the 
soil. 
 
Time Requirement 
Start small so that you can devote enough time to care for your crops. For a 10-foot by 10-foot garden, OSU 
researchers estimate that planting and cultivation takes 40 minutes per week. Allow 30 minutes for each 
watering session. Most vegetables are annual crops and demand on-going attention throughout the growing 
season. 
 
When Do I Begin? 
Ideally, you begin in the fall with a soil test to determine nutrient level and pH. If needed, add amendments 
to adjust pH. Over winter, plan your garden on paper. Decide what you want to grow, allocate space to each 
crop, and determine whether you will sow seeds directly in the ground or buy transplants. Many seed 
catalogs offer a planting calendar. 
 
A soil thermometer is a valuable tool in determining when to sow. Remember that seeds germinate after soil 
temperature reaches the minimum required. If you plant early crops such as peas, you may begin as early as 
February. Peas germinate in 35 degree soil, while basil seeds do so at 60 degrees or higher.  
 
If you want to keep your garden growing during the fall and winter, try some cool-season crops such as kale, 
broccoli  and beets. They are planted in mid- to late-summer for harvest the next spring. 
 
Soil Preparation 
A soil test reveals nutrient levels in your soil and amendments needed. Professional labs conduct full soil 
tests, and Clackamas County Master Gardeners do free pH tests. For the pH test schedule, check 
www.cmastergardeners.org. Add lime to balance acidic soil, if needed. Do so in the fall to give it time to 
work. 
Before digging, check if soil is workable. If you can squeeze water out of a handful of soil, wait. To improve 
soil structure, mix in 2-4 inches of compost. You may do this in the fall up to just before planting. If you are 
gardening in soil not previously cultivated, break up the clods with a broad fork, spading fork, cultivator, or 
rototiller. If you use a rototiller, stop when soil still has particles of different sizes; take care not to pulverize 
the soil. If you grow vegetables in a container, use potting mix, not garden soil.    
 

 
Planting 
Soil and air temperatures determine when we plant. Soil temperature is crucial to seed germination. The 
minimum soil temperature (  ̊F) required for some favorite crops are:  peas (35); onions(35); carrots (40); 
beans (50); eggplant/peppers/tomatoes (55); and basil (60).  Air temperature is crucial to good plant growth; 
optimum air temperature (  ̊F) for some favorites are:  peas (50-60); tomatoes (60-80 during the day, 59-68 at 
night); peppers (70-80); and cucumbers (75-80).  If you sow peas in late winter, they may germinate, but they 
won’t grow well until the air temperature warms up. 
 
Short-season crops mature in 50 days or less. You can sow seeds directly and still ensure a good harvest.  
Long-season crops, such as tomatoes, mature in 75-90 days. The gardener is usually in a race against time to 
harvest long-season crops before fall rains and cold nights arrive. Transplants, purchased from garden 
centers or started in your own greenhouse, give the gardener a head start. When buying transplants, select 
healthy plants firmly established but not yet showing encircling roots. Soak the root ball in water to rid air 
bubbles just before transplanting and water thoroughly after planting. 
 
Fertilizing 
Most vegetables are annual crops and need sufficient nutrients to produce well. In general, apply a balanced 
fertilizer containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) but give leafy greens more N, fruits and 
flowers more P, and roots more K. Fertilize according to the needs of the plant and fertility of your soil. 
Heavy feeders such as beet, collard, kale, lettuce, parsley, spinach, and tomato may need more fertilizer. 
Light feeders such as carrot, garlic, onion, chard, mustard, and pepper may need a moderate amount. Bean, 
pea, soybean, and clover fix nitrogen from the air and often do well with no fertilizer. 
 
Plants use only the nutrients that are dissolved in soil water, but most nutrients in soil are not in a soluble 
form. For immediate result, use water-soluble forms of fertilizer.  If you use organic fertilizers that are not in 
liquid form, apply a couple of months before planting.  Examples of organic fertilizers are fish emulsion (3-5% 
N); composted chicken manure (3% N); blood meal (12-15% N); bone meal (12-24% P); and kelp meal (2-5% 
K).   
 
Watering 
Water so that the root zone is evenly moist. Dig down 6 to 8 inches after watering to check soil moisture.  A 
drip system delivers water to the roots and is preferable to watering overhead which dampens leaves and 
can foster disease. If you water overhead, minimize splash and refrain from watering late in the day.  
Watering early in the day minimizes evaporation.   
 
Be vigilant to water during the most critical stage of your crop. Here are some examples: beans/peas–during 
flowering and pod development; broccoli/cabbage–during head formation and enlargement; onion–during 
bulb formation; eggplant/peppers/tomatoes–from blossom set to fruit enlargement; lettuce and other leafy 
vegetables–from germination to harvest.

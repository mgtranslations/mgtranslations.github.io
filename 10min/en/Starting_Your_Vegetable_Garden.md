## Starting Your Vegetable Garden  

### What to Grow  
Begin with what you like to eat, high-cost crops (herbs, for example), and short-season crops. If you eat salads, try sowing some lettuce seeds that mature in 40–50 days for early success. Expand your palette over time.  

### Space & Location  
- **Start small:** A 2-foot diameter by 18-inch deep container can work for leafy greens. Beginners may try a 10-foot by 10-foot plot. A well-tended garden produces many times more than a neglected one. A 30-foot by 30-foot garden will yield enough fresh produce for a family of 4.  
- **Find a sunny location:** 8 hours of sun is crucial to plants that bear fruit (tomato, cucumber, squash, eggplant, peppers, and melon); leafy vegetables (lettuce and spinach) tolerate partial shade.  
- **Choose or make a high spot:** Low areas tend to have drainage problems. Cold air settles in low spots and shortens the growing season. To remedy, consider making raised beds; it improves drainage and warms the soil.  

### Time Requirement  
Start small so that you can devote enough time to care for your crops. For a 10-foot by 10-foot garden, OSU researchers estimate that planting and cultivation take 40 minutes per week. Allow 30 minutes for each watering session. Most vegetables are annual crops and demand ongoing attention throughout the growing season.  

### When Do I Begin?  
Ideally, you begin in the fall with a soil test to determine nutrient level and pH. If needed, add amendments to adjust pH. Over winter, plan your garden on paper. Decide what you want to grow, allocate space to each crop, and determine whether you will sow seeds directly in the ground or buy transplants. Many seed catalogs offer a planting calendar.  

A soil thermometer is a valuable tool in determining when to sow. Remember that seeds germinate after soil temperature reaches the minimum required. If you plant early crops such as peas, you may begin as early as February. Peas germinate in 35-degree soil, while basil seeds do so at 60 degrees or higher.  

If you want to keep your garden growing during the fall and winter, try some cool-season crops such as kale, broccoli, and beets. They are planted in mid- to late-summer for harvest the next spring.  

### Soil Preparation  
A soil test reveals nutrient levels in your soil and amendments needed. Professional labs conduct full soil tests, and Clackamas County Master Gardeners do free pH tests. For the pH test schedule, check [www.cmastergardeners.org](http://www.cmastergardeners.org).  

- **Add lime:** Balance acidic soil, if needed. Do so in the fall to give it time to work.  
- **Check if soil is workable:** If you can squeeze water out of a handful of soil, wait.  
- **Improve soil structure:** Mix in 2–4 inches of compost. You may do this in the fall up to just before planting.  
- **Break up clods:** If you are gardening in soil not previously cultivated, use a broad fork, spading fork, cultivator, or rototiller. If you use a rototiller, stop when soil still has particles of different sizes; take care not to pulverize the soil.  
- **Container gardening:** Use potting mix, not garden soil.  

### Planting  
Soil and air temperatures determine when we plant.  

#### Soil Temperature  
The minimum soil temperature (°F) required for some favorite crops:  
- Peas: 35°F  
- Onions: 35°F  
- Carrots: 40°F  
- Beans: 50°F  
- Eggplant/Peppers/Tomatoes: 55°F  
- Basil: 60°F  

#### Air Temperature  
Optimum air temperature (°F) for some favorites:  
- Peas: 50–60°F  
- Tomatoes: 60–80°F during the day, 59–68°F at night  
- Peppers: 70–80°F  
- Cucumbers: 75–80°F  

If you sow peas in late winter, they may germinate, but they won’t grow well until the air temperature warms up.  

#### Short-Season vs. Long-Season Crops  
- **Short-season crops:** Mature in 50 days or less. You can sow seeds directly and still ensure a good harvest.  
- **Long-season crops:** Such as tomatoes, mature in 75–90 days. The gardener is usually in a race against time to harvest long-season crops before fall rains and cold nights arrive.  

#### Transplants  
Transplants, purchased from garden centers or started in your own greenhouse, give the gardener a head start.  
- Select healthy plants firmly established but not yet showing encircling roots.  
- Soak the root ball in water to rid air bubbles just before transplanting and water thoroughly after planting.  

### Fertilizing  
Most vegetables are annual crops and need sufficient nutrients to produce well.  

- **Balanced fertilizer:** Apply one containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).  
  - Leafy greens: More nitrogen (N).  
  - Fruits and flowers: More phosphorus (P).  
  - Roots: More potassium (K).  

#### Heavy Feeders  
Beet, collard, kale, lettuce, parsley, spinach, and tomato may need more fertilizer.  

#### Light Feeders  
Carrot, garlic, onion, chard, mustard, and pepper may need a moderate amount.  

#### Nitrogen-Fixing Crops  
Bean, pea, soybean, and clover fix nitrogen from the air and often do well with no fertilizer.  

#### Organic Fertilizers  
Apply a couple of months before planting for best results. Examples:  
- Fish emulsion: 3–5% N  
- Composted chicken manure: 3% N  
- Blood meal: 12–15% N  
- Bone meal: 12–24% P  
- Kelp meal: 2–5% K  

### Watering  
Water so that the root zone is evenly moist. Dig down 6 to 8 inches after watering to check soil moisture.  

- **Drip system:** Delivers water to the roots and is preferable to overhead watering, which dampens leaves and can foster disease.  
- **Overhead watering:** Minimize splash and refrain from watering late in the day. Watering early in the day minimizes evaporation.  

#### Critical Watering Stages  
Be vigilant during the most critical stage of your crop:  
- Beans/Peas: During flowering and pod development  
- Broccoli/Cabbage: During head formation and enlargement  
- Onion: During bulb formation  
- Eggplant/Peppers/Tomatoes: From blossom set to fruit enlargement  
- Lettuce and other leafy vegetables: From germination to harvest

Growing Blueberries 
Why Grow Blueberries? 
• Edible: Eat berries fresh; use in pies & other desserts; freeze, dry or can them for later use. 
• Long fruiting season: Each cultivar has a season of 4 to 6 weeks. Choosing different cultivars can lead to a 
season from late June through September. 
• Long-lived: Highbush blueberries are deciduous shrubs that can live 40 to 50 years.  
• Attractive plants: White or pink blossoms in spring, colorful fall foliage, and attractive bark in winter. 
 
Selecting a Cultivar 
• Plant more than one cultivar: Cross-pollination produces larger berries & lengthens the harvest season. 
• Examples of blueberries grown in home gardens (in order of ripening): Duke, Earliblue, Spartan, Patriot, 
Bluecrop, Jersey, Blueray, Legacy, Chandler and Elliott. 
 
Selecting a Site 
• Place in a sunny location: Need full sun for good yield and fruit quality. Avoid areas surrounded by trees 
that compete for water and nutrients, and that interfere with air movement around the plants. 
 
Preparing the Soil 
• Acid soil of pH 4.5 to 5.5 is required; test your soil to determine pH and lower pH with sulfur as needed. 
(See OSU Extension publication EC1560e for details). 
• Improve drainage and add organic matter, such as Douglas-fir sawdust or bark. Do not use compost or 
manures which have a very high pH. 
 
Establishing Your Planting 
• Timing:  Plant healthy, one- or two-gallon sized container plants in October or March through April.   
• How: Set plants at a similar depth to the top of the container soil.  Water thoroughly. To encourage root 
growth, prune off all flower buds in year one, and prune off some flower buds in year two.  
 
Weed Control 
• Keep at least a 4-foot area around the plants free of weeds during the growing season. 
• Blueberries have shallow roots. To prevent damage, weed by hand or cultivate with great care (shallow 
and not too close to the plant).  
 
Mulching 
• Mulch keeps the soil cool, conserves moisture, suppresses annual weeds, adds organic matter, and 
improves soil structure and acidity.   
• After planting, apply a mulch of Douglas fir sawdust or bark to a depth of 2 to 3 inches.   
• Increase the depth of the mulch to 6 inches over a period of 6 years.   
• You may have to apply 25 percent more nitrogen fertilizer on mulched plantings, depending on how fresh 
the sawdust. Fresh sawdust “ties up” nitrogen while it decomposes, so you need to add more for the 
plants to grow properly. 
 
Fertilizing 
 

• Types: ammonium sulfate, urea, rhododendron food, feather meal, cotton seed or soy bean meal. 
• Application: Sprinkle the fertilizer evenly within 12 to 18 inches of each plant, not directly on the crown or 
stems. The following chart provides the rate of nitrogen (N) per planting age (planting year = year 1).  
 
Planting year Rate of N (in ounces) per year  
1 0.4 
2 0.6 
3 0.7 
4 0.8 
5 1.0 
6 1.2 
7 1.3 
8 1.5 
Divide the total amount of N into three equal portions, applying the first in mid-April, the second in mid-
May, and the last in mid- to late-June. If you have used fresh sawdust mulch, apply the fertilizer on top of 
the mulch, but add 25% to the total rate. 
 
Watering 
• Blueberry plants need 1.5 to 3 inches of water per week. If there is insufficient rain, irrigate to provide 
water evenly and to a depth of 1 foot. Drip irrigation is ideal. 
 
Pruning 
• Timing: Blueberry plants need careful pruning in winter (late November to late February) to ensure good 
growth and fruiting.   
• How: In planting year: prune off all flower buds; plants must not be allowed to produce fruit. In year 2 
through 5, prune well to encourage leafy growth (to grow to a mature size) as well as fruit. 
• OSU resources: Pruning is challenging to all home gardeners. Insufficient pruning is the most common 
reason why plants do not perform well. Learn how to prune by studying OSU resources listed below.  
 
Pests & Diseases 
• Birds: Scare tactics have limited results; netting built on frames over plants will effectively deter the birds. 
• The most important diseases in blueberry are mummy berry, bacterial blight (Pseudomonas), and 
Blueberry Shock Virus. The most important pest of blueberry is Spotted Wing Drosophila, particularly for 
late-season cultivars.

To calculate how much product to use, 
divide the recommended rate of N by the 
percent N in the fertilizer you choose. To 
get 2 ounces of N, you need 9.5 ounces of 
ammonium sulfate that has 21% N (The 
calculation is 2/0.21) If you use blood meal 
(13-0-0), 15.4 ounces will give you 2 
ounces of N. (The calculation is 2/0.13)

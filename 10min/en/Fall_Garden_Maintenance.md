Fall Garden Maintenance  
 
Overview 
Fall is a good time to add new plantings, move or 
transplant shrubs and perennials, and mulch 
your garden beds. Diseases such as root rot, leaf 
spot, and stem cankers thrive in fall rain. Proper 
cleanup can prevent diseases from developing 
and is more effective than treating an infected 
plant. 
 
General Tips 
Know the first frost date in your area. In the 
Willamette Valley, this date is usually around the 
first week in October. Bring tender plants indoors 
to overwinter before then. Be sure to clean their 
leaves and check for insects or their eggs first. 
 
Improve your soil. Amend the soil with compost 
to improve drainage. Soils high in organic matter 
tend to stay warmer in the winter, thus reducing 
plant loss. Test soil and, if needed, apply lime 
now. If alkalinity needs to be reduced, add 
sulphur. 
 
Check if your plants need watering especially 
after prolonged dry and windy weather. Give 
extra attention to newly planted beds and plants 
under or near large established trees. 
 
Look for slugs and slug eggs under boards and 
rocks and in dense foliage and kill them by 
squashing or cutting. Bait for slugs whenever 
needed and be ready in early spring with another 
fresh application. Trap moles and gophers as well 
as controlling other pest problems. 
Mulch is insulation. It keeps the soil around plant 
roots cooler on warm days and warmer at cold 
nights. After plants are dormant, apply 3-4” of 
well composted garden mulch. Taper depth to 
leave the crowns of plants and tree trunks 
uncovered.  
Remove and destroy diseased plants before they 
infect their neighbors.  It is easier to spot tree 
and shrub diseases when leaves are present. 
Unless your compost pile heats to 160 degrees or 
higher, leave diseased plant parts out of your 
compost.  
 
When removing diseased branches, prune two or 
three inches below the infected area. If you cut 
into the infected part of the limb, sterilize 
pruning equipment by wiping with rubbing 
alcohol or a solution of one part household 
bleach and nine parts water. 
 
Ornamentals 
Let some plants self-sow in the fall. After 
seedlings come up in the spring, thin to sculpt 
the color pattern you want. Sweet peas, 
sunflowers, columbine, annual delphiniums, 
poppies, calendula, nasturtiums, clarkia, alyssum 
and even petunias can be nurtured this way to 
return year after year. Annual herbs are willing 
self-sowers. Dill and cilantro can come back 
every year if the seed heads are left on the plant. 
 
Gather herbs, seed heads and flowers for drying. 
Collect dried seeds from open pollinated flowers 
and vegetables for sowing next year. 
 
Shorten rose canes to 30” or hip-high to prevent 
wind damage.  Finish pruning roses in February. 
Prune summer-blooming shrubs in late winter or 
early spring. Fall pruning should be avoided as it 
stimulates new growth which is susceptible to 
winter damage. 
 
Herbaceous perennials such as hostas, daylilies, 
astilbes, monardas, peonies, and solidagos die 
back to the ground in the fall and re-emerge in 
the spring. Once frost turns their top brown, 
prune to the ground.   
 
Semi-herbaceous perennials, such as rudbeckias, 
penstemons and Shasta daisies, lose upper 
foliage in the cold but retain basal foliage. 

Remove dead tops but leave 2-3 inches of green 
foliage at the base.   
 
Plant spring blooming bulbs and divide large 
perennials such as daylilies, hellebores, and 
hostas. This will control their size and renew 
blooming. 
 
Stake newly planted deciduous trees so they do 
not rock in the wind and loosen their roots.  
Remove the stakes in the spring. 
 
Dig up tender bulbs such as dahlias, begonias, 
caladiums, cannas, and gladiolas.  Wrap them in 
moist material and store in a cool, dark space. 
 
Ornamental grasses have lovely seed heads in 
the fall and winter.  It is best to prune them in 
the spring when young shoots begin to appear. 
 
Rake up tree and shrub leaves and compost 
unless they show signs of disease. 
 
Apply slow release fertilizer for your lawn to help 
boost root growth.  Look for lawn fertilizer 
labeled for fall/winter applications.  Apply 
herbicides to control broadleaf weeds.  Thatch 
the lawn by raking it and overseed where the 
lawn is not thick and vigorous.   
 
Edibles 
Remove diseased plant refuse. Spade under or 
compost healthy crop refuse.  
 
Remove old fruiting canes off of raspberries, 
blackberries and boysenberries.   
 
Plant cover crops in the vegetable garden and 
newly established beds that are not yet planted. 
Cover crops provide valuable soil protection by 
reducing erosion, suppressing weeds, improving 
soil tilth and providing large amounts of organic 
material.  Examples of cover crops are: rye, 
crimson clover, hairy vetch, winter wheat. Have a 
plan for processing the cover crops before they 
go to seed. 
 
 
Housekeeping Chores 
• Clean out bird houses for use as roosting 
boxes in the winter or for use in the spring. 
• Clean out cold frames for winter use. 
• Store garden chemicals in a secure, dry place 
– away from kids and pets. 
• Clean fallen leaves and debris from gutters 
and downspouts. 
• Winterize irrigation system. 
• Bring in clay pots or garden ornaments to 
prevent damage from fluctuating winter 
temperatures. 
• Sharpen pruning shears and other cutting 
tools.   
• Clean, sand and oil garden tools before 
storing them for the winter.   
• Drain old gas in the lawn mower after the last 
mowing.  Have the mower blades sharpened.

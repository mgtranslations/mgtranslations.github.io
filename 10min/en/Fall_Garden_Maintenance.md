## Fall Garden Maintenance  

### Overview  
Fall is a good time to add new plantings, move or transplant shrubs and perennials, and mulch your garden beds. Diseases such as root rot, leaf spot, and stem cankers thrive in fall rain. Proper cleanup can prevent diseases from developing and is more effective than treating an infected plant.  

### General Tips  
- **Know the first frost date in your area.**  
  In the Willamette Valley, this date is usually around the first week in October. Bring tender plants indoors to overwinter before then. Be sure to clean their leaves and check for insects or their eggs first.  

- **Improve your soil.**  
  Amend the soil with compost to improve drainage. Soils high in organic matter tend to stay warmer in the winter, thus reducing plant loss. Test soil and, if needed, apply lime now. If alkalinity needs to be reduced, add sulfur.  

- **Check if your plants need watering,** especially after prolonged dry and windy weather. Give extra attention to newly planted beds and plants under or near large established trees.  

- **Look for slugs and slug eggs** under boards, rocks, and in dense foliage. Kill them by squashing or cutting. Bait for slugs whenever needed and be ready in early spring with another fresh application. Trap moles and gophers as well as controlling other pest problems.  

- **Mulch is insulation.**  
  It keeps the soil around plant roots cooler on warm days and warmer on cold nights. After plants are dormant, apply 3–4 inches of well-composted garden mulch. Taper depth to leave the crowns of plants and tree trunks uncovered.  

- **Remove and destroy diseased plants** before they infect their neighbors. It is easier to spot tree and shrub diseases when leaves are present. Unless your compost pile heats to 160°F or higher, leave diseased plant parts out of your compost.  

- **When removing diseased branches,** prune two or three inches below the infected area. If you cut into the infected part of the limb, sterilize pruning equipment by wiping with rubbing alcohol or a solution of one part household bleach and nine parts water.  

### Ornamentals  
- **Let some plants self-sow in the fall.**  
  After seedlings come up in the spring, thin to sculpt the color pattern you want. Sweet peas, sunflowers, columbine, annual delphiniums, poppies, calendula, nasturtiums, clarkia, alyssum, and even petunias can be nurtured this way to return year after year. Annual herbs such as dill and cilantro can also self-sow if seed heads are left on the plant.  

- **Gather herbs, seed heads, and flowers for drying.**  
  Collect dried seeds from open-pollinated flowers and vegetables for sowing next year.  

- **Shorten rose canes** to 30 inches or hip-high to prevent wind damage. Finish pruning roses in February. Prune summer-blooming shrubs in late winter or early spring. Avoid fall pruning as it stimulates new growth, which is susceptible to winter damage.  

- **Herbaceous perennials** such as hostas, daylilies, astilbes, monardas, peonies, and solidagos die back to the ground in the fall and re-emerge in the spring. Once frost turns their tops brown, prune to the ground.  

- **Semi-herbaceous perennials** such as rudbeckias, penstemons, and Shasta daisies lose upper foliage in the cold but retain basal foliage. Remove dead tops but leave 2–3 inches of green foliage at the base.  

- **Plant spring-blooming bulbs** and divide large perennials such as daylilies, hellebores, and hostas. This will control their size and renew blooming.  

- **Stake newly planted deciduous trees** so they do not rock in the wind and loosen their roots. Remove the stakes in the spring.  

- **Dig up tender bulbs** such as dahlias, begonias, caladiums, cannas, and gladiolas. Wrap them in moist material and store in a cool, dark space.  

- **Ornamental grasses** have lovely seed heads in the fall and winter. It is best to prune them in the spring when young shoots begin to appear.  

- **Rake up tree and shrub leaves** and compost them unless they show signs of disease.  

- **Apply slow-release fertilizer** for your lawn to help boost root growth. Look for lawn fertilizer labeled for fall/winter applications. Apply herbicides to control broadleaf weeds. Thatch the lawn by raking it and overseed where the lawn is not thick and vigorous.  

### Edibles  
- **Remove diseased plant refuse.**  
  Spade under or compost healthy crop refuse.  

- **Remove old fruiting canes** from raspberries, blackberries, and boysenberries.  

- **Plant cover crops** in the vegetable garden and newly established beds that are not yet planted. Cover crops provide valuable soil protection by reducing erosion, suppressing weeds, improving soil tilth, and providing large amounts of organic material. Examples of cover crops include rye, crimson clover, hairy vetch, and winter wheat. Have a plan for processing the cover crops before they go to seed.  

### Housekeeping Chores  
- Clean out birdhouses for use as roosting boxes in the winter or for use in the spring.  
- Clean out cold frames for winter use.  
- Store garden chemicals in a secure, dry place—away from kids and pets.  
- Clean fallen leaves and debris from gutters and downspouts.  
- Winterize the irrigation system.  
- Bring in clay pots or garden ornaments to prevent damage from fluctuating winter temperatures.  
- Sharpen pruning shears and other cutting tools.  
- Clean, sand, and oil garden tools before storing them for the winter.  
- Drain old gas in the lawn mower after the last mowing. Have the mower blades sharpened.

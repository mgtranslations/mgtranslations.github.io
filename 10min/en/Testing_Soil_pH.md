## Testing Soil pH

### Overview

Successful gardeners seeking to optimize the results of growing plants know the importance of soil pH, which is as crucial as location, exposure, and soil preparation. Soil pH is the measurement of the degree of acidity (sourness) or alkalinity (sweetness) of soil. It is measured on a scale of 0 to 14, with lower numbers more acidic and higher numbers more alkaline. The value of 7.0 is neutral—i.e., neither acidic nor alkaline.

When pH levels are too high or too low, minerals are bound to soil particles and thus unavailable to the plant. In this situation, adding more fertilizer won’t do any good. Both the quantities of minerals present in native soil and annual rainfall affect soil pH. In Western Oregon, rain tends to leach out minerals and results in soils that become more acidic. In Eastern Oregon, soils are more alkaline.

In general, most plants grow best in a neutral soil pH, although there are important exceptions. For example:

- Blueberries, azaleas, and rhododendrons do well in soil pH between 4.5 and 5.5.
- Lawns favor a pH of 5.5 to 6.
- Roses do best in soils with a pH of 6.5 to 7.

### Types of Soil Test

There are two primary types of soil tests:

1. **Mineral Test**: Measures soil nutrients available to the plant. This test needs to be done in a professional lab.
2. **Soil pH Test**: Can be checked at home using a simple kit.

Clackamas County Master Gardeners conduct free soil pH testing several times a year using sophisticated equipment for more accurate results. Check [www.clackamascountymastergardeners.org](http://www.clackamascountymastergardeners.org) or ask a Master Gardener for dates of these free pH testing events.

### How to Take a Soil Sample

Follow these steps carefully to ensure the sample truly represents the entire area:

1. **Determine the number of samples**:
   - Base this on topography and crop/plants grown.
   - Each area should have its own sample. For example:
     - A hillside and a low, wet area should have separate samples.
     - Vegetable garden, lawn, and perennial bed should each have separate samples.

2. **Prepare containers**:
   - Use clean plastic or glass jars or plastic bags.
   - Ideal capacity is about 1 cup, although larger containers are acceptable.

3. **Collect soil**:
   - Each sample should contain between ½ and ¾ cup of soil.
   - Mix several smaller sub-samples from the area you wish to test.

4. **Use clean tools**:
   - Avoid galvanized, bronze, or brass tools.
   - Ensure hands and gloves are clean to prevent contamination.

5. **Take samples at the correct depth**:
   - For vegetable gardens, sample between the surface and 8” deep.

6. **Label each sample**:
   - Include your name and the location in your garden (e.g., rose bed, west lawn, vegetable garden).

7. **Avoid unusual areas**:
   - Do not take samples from compost or manure piles, or burned areas, as they do not represent the soil in your garden.

### Test Results and Remedies

Each sample will yield a pH reading:

- **Low numbers** indicate acidic soil.
- **High numbers** indicate alkaline soil.

When Master Gardeners conduct the test, they also help interpret the results and provide information on remedies. It is best to adjust soil pH over several years. Add the appropriate amendment in the fall and check the soil pH again in 3 to 6 months. Repeat as needed.

#### Raising Soil pH

- Add lime in the fall for optimal results.
- Use **5 to 10 pounds of lime per 100 square feet** if mixing into the soil before planting.
- For established lawns or plants, add **5 pounds per 100 square feet**.
- Retest soil pH in 3 to 6 months to see if the target pH has been achieved.

**Types of Lime:**

- Powdered, granular, or pelletized lime.
- Granular or pelletized lime is easier to spread.
- If using powdered lime, wear a mask.
- Dolomite lime contains magnesium and is a good choice for gardeners in Western Oregon, where soils are often deficient in magnesium.

#### Lowering Soil pH

- Add elemental sulfur in the fall for best results.
- For established trees and shrubs, add a small amount to the soil along the drip line or broadcast in a band along a row of blueberries.
- If using powdered sulfur, wear a mask.

For more information about lowering soil pH, see **EC 1560-E**. There is no test to determine sulfur amendment amounts. A soil pH test in 3 to 6 months will let you know if more is needed.

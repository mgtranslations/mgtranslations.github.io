# Growing Raspberries

### Why Grow Raspberries?
Raspberries are delicious, delicate, and best enjoyed freshly picked. They are also long-lived:
- Red and yellow raspberries can remain productive for up to 15 years.
- Black raspberries stay productive for 4 to 8 years.

### Types and Selections
Your first choice is between types that produce:
1. **Once, in early summer** (floricane-fruiting).
2. **Twice, in summer and fall** (primocane-fruiting).

Next, choose among cultivars that vary in fruit color and flavor. You may wish to conduct taste tests before making a selection or consult the OSU publication on cultivated varieties that perform well in our region. Examples include:
- **Red floricane-fruiting cultivars**: Willamette, Meeker, Cascade Delight.
- **Red primocane-fruiting cultivars**: Vintage, Heritage, Caroline.
- **Yellow primocane-fruiting cultivars**: Fallgold, Anne.
- **Black floricane-fruiting cultivars**: Munger, Jewel.
- **Purple floricane-fruiting cultivars**: Royalty, Brandywine.

### Selecting a Site
Raspberries can tolerate partial shade, but they yield better and have higher fruit quality in full sun. Avoid sites where potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, other caneberries, or strawberries have grown in the last 3 years, as these crops share many of the same insects and diseases as raspberries.

Grow raspberries in well-drained, fertile, loamy soil with moderate water-holding capacity. Avoid heavy clay soils.

### Preparing the Soil
- Grow raspberries on a raised mound (1½ to 2 feet high and 2 feet wide) or in a raised bed to ensure excellent drainage.
- Maintain soil pH between **5.6 and 6.5**.
- In the year before planting, eliminate all perennial weeds.
- Apply organic matter (e.g., manure, compost, leaves, or sawdust) in summer or fall and mix it into the soil. Ensure it is decomposed by planting time.
- Plant raspberries the year after soil preparation.

### Planting
Raspberries are usually sold as bare-root plants. Purchase certified disease-free plants to minimize disease problems.

- **Planting time**: Early spring, as soon as the soil is workable.
- **Planting method**:
  1. Dig a hole in amended soil wide enough to accommodate roots spread out.
  2. Place the highest point where roots attach to canes about 1 to 2 inches below ground level.
  3. Cover with soil and water well to remove air pockets.

### Fertilizing

#### New Plantings
In the planting year, fertilize each plant with a total of **2 ounces of nitrogen (N)** per 10-foot row. Use a well-balanced fertilizer such as **16-16-16** or an organic source (e.g., cottonseed meal).

To calculate the amount needed:
- Divide 2 ounces by the percent of nitrogen in the fertilizer.
  - Example: You need **12 ounces of 16-16-16 fertilizer** to get 2 ounces of N (2 ounces ÷ percent of N = ounces of fertilizer needed).

Do not apply all the fertilizer at once. Divide the total amount into thirds:
1. Apply the first third 2 weeks after planting.
2. Apply the second third 1 month later.
3. Apply the final third an additional month later.

#### Established Plants
Apply fertilizer annually to maintain good growth:
- **Amount**: 2 to 3 ounces of nitrogen per 10-foot row.
  - Example: 13 to 19 ounces of 16-16-16 fertilizer or 2.5 pounds of 5-5-3 fertilizer.
- **Timing**:
  - Apply half between late March and early April.
  - Apply the rest in early June.
- **Primocane-fruiting raspberries**: Fertilize with an additional 0.5 to 1 ounce of nitrogen in late July.

### Watering
Established plants need **1 to 1½ inches of water per week** from mid-June through late summer. Water the root zone only, avoiding wetting the fruiting area.

### Weed Management
- Cultivate to control weeds and canes that develop outside the rows.
- Cultivate no deeper than **1 to 2 inches** to prevent root damage.
- Use mulch to suppress weeds and maintain soil moisture.

### Trellising & Pruning
Pruning methods vary among raspberry types:

- **Summer-bearing raspberries**:
  - Support canes upright with trellising.
  - Remove dead floricanes after fruiting in summer or fall.
  - In winter, thin out broken or weak primocanes and train canes to the trellis (canes may be topped to about 6 feet).

- **Primocane-fruiting raspberries**:
  - To produce two crops:
    - Remove dead floricanes after fruiting in summer or fall.
    - Remove the dead tip on primocanes (the part that fruited last fall).
  - To produce one crop:
    - Prune in late winter by cutting all canes back to the ground.
    - The fall crop will be borne on the tips of the primocanes that grow during the summer.
    - Fall-bearing raspberries need only a temporary support structure.

### Pests and Diseases
Common issues include:
- **Phytophthora root rot**: Thrives in heavy clay soils and wet root areas, killing floricanes.
- Other pests: Root weevil, spider mites, aphids.
- Diseases: Powdery mildew, Anthracnose, Verticillium wilt.

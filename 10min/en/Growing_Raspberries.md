Growing Raspberries  
 
Why Grow Raspberries?  
They are delicious, delicate, and best enjoyed freshly picked. They also are long-lived: red & yellow 
raspberries can remain productive up to 15 years; black raspberries stay productive for 4 to 8 years.  
 
Types and Selections  
Your first choice is between types that produce once, in early summer (floricane-fruiting), and those that 
produce twice, in summer and fall (primocane-fruiting). Next you need to choose among many that vary 
in fruit color and flavor. You may wish to conduct taste tests before making a selection. Or you may 
consult the OSU publication on cultivated varieties (cultivars) that perform well in our region. Examples: 
red floricane-fruiting cultivars (Willamette, Meeker & Cascade Delight); red primocane-fruiting cultivars 
(Vintage, Heritage & Caroline); yellow primocane-fruiting (Fallgold & Anne); black floricane-fruiting 
(Munger & Jewel); and purple floricane-fruiting (Royalty & Brandywine).  
 
Selecting a Site  
Raspberries can tolerate partial shade, but in full sun they have better yield and fruit quality. Avoid a site 
where potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, other caneberries, or strawberries have grown the last 3 
years. These crops are susceptible to many of the same insects and diseases as raspberries. Grow plants in 
well-drained, fertile, loamy soil with moderate water-holding capacity. Avoid heavy clay soils.  
 
Preparing the Soil  
It is best to grow raspberries on a raised mound 1½ to 2 feet high & 2 feet wide to provide excellent 
drainage. Or build a raised bed with good drainage. Soil pH should be between 5.6 and 6.5.  
In the year before planting, eliminate all perennial weeds. Apply organic matter in the summer or fall – 
you may use manure, compost, leaves, or sawdust -- mix into the soil. Be sure it is decomposed by 
planting time. Plant raspberries the year after soil preparation. 
 
Planting  
Raspberries are usually sold as bare-root plants. Purchase certified disease-free plants to minimize disease 
problems. Plant early in the spring as soon as soil is workable. To plant, dig a hole in amended soil that is 
wide enough to accommodate roots spread out. Place the highest point where roots attach to canes, 
about 1 to 2 inches below ground level. Cover with soil and water well to remove air pockets.  
 
Fertilizing  
In the planting year, fertilize each plant with a total of 2 ounces of nitrogen (N) per a 10-foot row. Use a 
well-balanced fertilizer such as 16-16-16 or an organic source (e.g. cotton seed meal). You can calculate 
the amount needed by dividing 2 ounces by the percent of nitrogen. For example, you need 12 ounces of 
16-16-16 fertilizer to get 2 ounces of N (2 ounces/percent of N in fertilizer= ounces of fertilizer needed). In 
new plantings, do not apply all the fertilizer at once. Divide the total amount into thirds. Apply the first 
third 2 weeks after planting, the next third 1 month later, and the final third an additional month later. 
 

For established plants, apply fertilizer annually to maintain good growth. Each year, apply a total of 2 to 3 
ounces of nitrogen per 10-foot row. This would be 13 to 19 ounces of 16-16-16 fertilizer or 2.5 pounds of 
5-5-3 fertilizer. Apply half between late March to early April and the rest in early June. Fertilize 
primocane-fruiting raspberries with an additional 0.5 to 1 ounce of N in late July.  
 
Watering  
Established plants need 1 to 1½ inches of water per week from mid-June through late summer. Take care 
to water the root zone only while avoiding wetting the fruiting area.  
 
Weed Management  
Cultivate to control weeds and canes that develop outside the rows. Cultivate no deeper than 1 to 2 
inches to prevent root damage. Mulch can be used to suppress weeds and maintain soil moisture.  
 
Trellising & Pruning  
Pruning methods for raspberry vary a great deal among raspberry types. Very briefly, summer-bearing 
raspberries need support to hold the canes upright. Prune by removing dead floricanes after fruiting in 
summer or in the fall.  In winter thin out any broken or weak primocanes and train the canes to the trellis 
(these may be topped to about 6 feet). To produce two crops on primocane-fruiting raspberries, remove 
dead floricanes after fruiting in summer or fall.  Then remove the dead tip on the primocanes (part that 
fruited last fall).  To produce only one crop of primocane-fruiting raspberry, prune in late winter by cutting 
all canes back to the ground. The fall crop will be borne on the tips of the primocane that grow during the 
summer. In this scenario, fall-bearing raspberries need only a temporary support structure. 
 
Pests and Diseases  
Phytophthora root rot can be a serious problem. Heavy clay soils and wet root areas are ideal conditions 
for this fungus that kills the floricanes. Other pests include root weevil, spider mites, aphids, powdery 
mildew, Anthracnose and Verticilium wilt.

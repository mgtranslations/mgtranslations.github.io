Growing Strawberries 
 
Why Grow Strawberries? 
• If you care for plants properly, you can obtain enough berries for your family from a relatively small area. 
• Strawberry plantings can remain productive for 3 or 4 fruiting years.   
 
Types of Strawberries 
• June-bearers – Produce only one crop per year, mainly in June. Examples include Hood, Totem, Benton, 
Sweet Sunrise and Tillamook.  They produce many runners. 
• Everbearers – Produce two crops, one in June or July and the other in the fall. Examples include Quinault 
and Fort Laramie.  They produce few runners. 
• Day-neutrals – Produce fruit almost continuously through the growing season except when it is very hot. 
These are the best type for the home garden and containers. Examples include Albion, Seascape, Selva, 
Tristar and Tribute. 
Selecting a Site 
• Full sun is needed for best production and fruit quality. 
• To minimize insect and disease problems, rotate the site each time you make a new planting (every 3 to 4 
years). 
• Avoid planting where tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, eggplants, strawberries, raspberries or blackberries 
have grown in the past 3 years. These plants can be the hosts for fungi that cause diseases, such as 
Verticillium wilt, for your strawberries. 
 
Preparing the Soil 
• Best: A raised bed of well-drained loamy soil, high in organic matter that has a pH between 5.6 and 6.5   
• Avoid: Planting in heavy clay soils. If the only soil available has poor drainage, you may be able to improve 
it by adding organic matter.   
 
Planting Systems 
There are two systems: Matted-row and Hill systems.   
• Hill system — For day-neutrals: set plants 12 to 15 inches apart in double- or triple-wide rows and leaving 
1½ to 2 feet wide aisles between. 
• Matted-row system — For June-bearers: set plants about 15 inches apart in the row with 3 to 4 feet 
between rows to produce a 1.5-foot-wide mat of plants.    
 
Planting 
• Purchase certified disease-free plants. Do not plant runners from your old patch or your neighbor’s. 
• Plant as early as you can work the soil in spring.   
• Planting depth is very important for strawberries.  At planting, dig a hole for each plant large enough to 
accommodate the roots without bending them.  Spread the root mass and set the plant at the same depth 
it was in the nursery container; with bare root plants, be sure the midpoint of the crown is level with the 
soil surface. 
 

• June-bearers produce very little fruit in the planting year, and it is best to remove any blossoms that come 
on during the first summer so as not to stress the plants.  With day-neutrals, remove only the first flush of 
flowers that come up immediately after planting. Day-neutrals will produce a baby crop that 1
st
 summer.  
All types will be in full production the year after planting. 
 
Fertilizing 
• Observe plant growth: Pale green or yellow leaves and poor runner growth may indicate nitrogen (N) 
deficiency.  
• In the planting year, fertilize plants with a well-balanced fertilizer such as 16-16-16 or an organic product.  
For a 100-ft row, apply 2 ounces of nitrogen (N) one or two weeks after planting. This is equivalent to 13 
ounces of 16-16-16 (2 ounces/0.16).  Apply another 2 ounces of N one month later (late May) and another 
0.5 to 1 ounce of N in late June.  
• For established strawberries, fertilization timing depends on the type grown. For June-bearers fertilize 
after harvest. Cut the old leaves off about 1 to 2 weeks after last fruit harvest then apply 4 ounces of N per 
100-ft row, spreading it evenly over the entire row length and width.  Irrigate right after fertilizing.  For 
day-neutral cultivars apply N throughout most of the growing and fruiting season; apply 1 ounce of N per 
100-ft row in EACH of early April, May, June, and July, and consider applying an additional 1 ounce of N in 
August if plant vigor is moderate to good.  
 
Irrigation 
• 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week during the growing season. Don’t subject plants to drought stress. 
 
Weed Management 
• Weeds compete with plants for water and nutrients, so keep weeds out of plantings by removing them by 
hand. If you grow day-neutral cultivars in the hill system, you can use plastic mulch with irrigation system, 
such as drip, underneath. 
 
Pests and Diseases 
• The most serious disease problems of strawberries are Botrytis, fruit rot, root rot, and Verticillium wilt.   
• Insect problems include root weevil, aphid, spider mite, and crown moth.

Gardening with Children Ages 4-7 
Gardening with children can be one of the most rewarding experiences for both the child and the par-
ent, grandparent, or mentor. Children are natural gardeners because they are curious, learn by doing, 
and enjoy playing in the dirt. 
 
Working together in the garden can provide hours of quality time each week and encourages a child’s 
interest in the workings of nature and science. Children also appreciate the sensory stimulation, 
whether it is pouring water from a container or working in the soil to remove weeds. 
 
Why Garden with Children? 
• They can experience the cycle of life firsthand. 
• It will teach them responsibility and foster creativity. 
• It will give them an understanding of our dependence on nature and its abundance. 
 
Vegetable gardening can be especially rewarding for children of all ages. Young children are advan-
taged when you choose vegetable seeds that are large and easier for small hands to manage. They 
also germinate more quickly, producing edible results in a single season. It promotes good nutrition 
and introduces children to foods that are new to them. They will be more likely to try new foods be-
cause they grew them themselves. 
 
Ideas to Consider  
• Give them their own space, whether a raised bed, pots, or ground plots. Each child should have 
their own space. 
• Keep it small because a smaller space is more manageable, and everything seems larger through a 
child’s eyes.  Start small and increase the size with their increasing age and interest. 
• Place their garden in the best possible spot with adequate sun and a water source. 
• Use serious work tools. Do not give them plastic tools that may break and make a new gardener 
frustrated. 
 
Some Activities 
You can adjust the amount of work to fit the child and the time frame. Remember, it is important to 
make the experience rewarding for both of you, so be sure to think about the scope of the activity 
and quit before anyone becomes overwhelmed or frustrated. That includes adults.  
 
Plant flowers or vegetables for pollinators like bees, birds, and butterflies. Gardeners value insects 
and pollinators that live in and visit the garden. You can plant sunflowers, zinnias, or nasturtiums. 
They are attractive and provide food for pollinators. Check out these publications from Oregon State 
University: Encouraging Beneficial Insects in Your Garden https://catalog.extension.oregon-

Go on a slug hunt. Children will learn how slugs play a role in an ecosystem. There are three common 
slugs in the Pacific Northwest: Banana slug (a native and a beneficial), leopard slug and red roundback 
slug. The gray garden slug is the most destructive of crops. Learn that slugs have predators like snakes 
and salamanders and even though slugs and snails are “pests” to gardeners, they play a key role in 
the ecosystem of the garden. If you choose to dispose of found slugs or snails, you can do so gently by 
placing them in a bucket of soapy water. Check out these resources: Identifying Slugs and Snails

Children love to hunt for “decomposers.” Worms, sowbugs, ants, and snails are all part of the ecosys-
tem and are essential in breaking down organic matter into humus. They are to be celebrated. Have 
the children dig a small bucket of soil or dig in a small area of the garden and keep track of the num-
ber of “decomposers” they locate. It helps if they can have a microscope or magnifying glass to use in 
their quest. Check out Oregon State University’s resource on decomposers:

Remember to give the kids the essential information about planting in a spot with the most sunlight 
and making sure the soil covers the seeds (not too deeply). Encourage them to observe how the in-
sects interact with the plants as they grow. Some favorite vegetable seeds for kids to plant: pump-
kins, pole beans, radishes, snap peas, scarlet runner beans, and cherry tomatoes.  
 
Add Literacy  
There are many wonderful picture and instructional books about gardening that children will appreci-
ate before they begin and while they are working in the garden. Reading aloud to them invites ques-
tioning and can be a springboard for garden plans. Your local librarian will be happy to help you find 
resources that both you and your child will enjoy. Here are a few suggestions: 
• “From Seed to Plant” by Gail Gibbons 
• “The Tiny Seed” by Eric Carle 
• “Growing Vegetable Soup” by Lois Ehlert 
• “The Vegetables We Eat” by Gail Gibbons 
• “The Carrot Seed” by Ruth Krause 
• “Muncha! Muncha! Muncha!” by Candace Fleming 
• “Flip, Float, Fly: Seeds on the Move” by JoAnn Early Macken 
• “Berries, Nuts and Seeds” by Diane L. Burns 
• “Jack’s Garden” by Henry Cole

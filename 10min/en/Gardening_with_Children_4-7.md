## Gardening with Children Ages 4-7

Gardening with children can be one of the most rewarding experiences for both the child and the parent, grandparent, or mentor. Children are natural gardeners because they are curious, learn by doing, and enjoy playing in the dirt.

Working together in the garden can provide hours of quality time each week and encourages a child’s interest in the workings of nature and science. Children also appreciate the sensory stimulation, whether it is pouring water from a container or working in the soil to remove weeds.

### Why Garden with Children?

- They can experience the cycle of life firsthand.
- It will teach them responsibility and foster creativity.
- It will give them an understanding of our dependence on nature and its abundance.

Vegetable gardening can be especially rewarding for children of all ages. Young children are advantaged when you choose vegetable seeds that are large and easier for small hands to manage. They also germinate more quickly, producing edible results in a single season. Gardening promotes good nutrition and introduces children to foods that are new to them. They will be more likely to try new foods because they grew them themselves.

### Ideas to Consider

- **Give them their own space**: Whether a raised bed, pots, or ground plots, each child should have their own space.
- **Keep it small**: A smaller space is more manageable, and everything seems larger through a child’s eyes. Start small and increase the size with their increasing age and interest.
- **Place their garden in the best possible spot**: Ensure adequate sun and a water source.
- **Use serious work tools**: Do not give them plastic tools that may break and frustrate a new gardener.

### Some Activities

You can adjust the amount of work to fit the child and the time frame. Remember, it is important to make the experience rewarding for both of you, so be sure to think about the scope of the activity and quit before anyone becomes overwhelmed or frustrated—including adults.

#### Plant Flowers or Vegetables for Pollinators

Gardeners value insects and pollinators that live in and visit the garden. You can plant sunflowers, zinnias, or nasturtiums. They are attractive and provide food for pollinators.

#### Go on a Slug Hunt

Children will learn how slugs play a role in an ecosystem. There are three common slugs in the Pacific Northwest:

- **Banana slug**: A native and beneficial.
- **Leopard slug** and **red roundback slug**.
- **Gray garden slug**: The most destructive of crops.

Slugs have predators like snakes and salamanders. Even though slugs and snails are “pests” to gardeners, they play a key role in the ecosystem of the garden. If you choose to dispose of found slugs or snails, you can do so gently by placing them in a bucket of soapy water.

#### Hunt for Decomposers

Worms, sowbugs, ants, and snails are all part of the ecosystem and are essential in breaking down organic matter into humus. They are to be celebrated.

Have the children dig a small bucket of soil or dig in a small area of the garden and keep track of the number of “decomposers” they locate. It helps if they can have a microscope or magnifying glass to use in their quest.

Check out Oregon State University’s resource on decomposers:

- [Worms as Decomposers](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/sites/lpi.oregonstate.edu/files/pdf/hyp/lessons-manuals/K12/K5/grade_three_worms_as_decomposers.pdf)

#### Planting Tips

Give kids essential information about planting in a spot with the most sunlight and ensuring the soil covers the seeds (not too deeply). Encourage them to observe how insects interact with the plants as they grow.

Some favorite vegetable seeds for kids to plant:

- Pumpkins
- Pole beans
- Radishes
- Snap peas
- Scarlet runner beans
- Cherry tomatoes

### Add Literacy

There are many wonderful picture and instructional books about gardening that children will appreciate before they begin and while they are working in the garden. Reading aloud to them invites questioning and can be a springboard for garden plans. Your local librarian will be happy to help you find resources that both you and your child will enjoy.

Saving Seeds 
Why Collect Seeds? 
Seed saving teaches self-sufficiency.  It also allows us to select for flavor and for adaptation to local soil, 
climate and pests. 
 
Plant Types 
Collecting seeds from annual plants is the easiest.  Plants such as tomatoes, beans, peas and lettuce 
complete their entire life cycle in one growing season and are self-pollinating.  Annual vine crops such as 
cucumbers, squash, melons and pumpkins are more difficult to save due to cross-pollination.  
Biennials such as carrots, parsley, and Swiss chard live two years and produce seeds in their second year.  
Collecting seeds can be difficult due to over-wintering needs and cross-pollination. 
Perennials live 3 years or longer and are usually propagated by cuttings or divisions, not by seeds.  
 
How Pollination Happens 
There are 3 means of pollination: wind, insects and humans. 
Open pollination is the ability to cross with other plants in the same family or variety.  Plants in this 
group could be self-pollinated, which makes seeds collection easy, or cross-pollinated, which makes seed 
collection more difficult. 
Self-pollination refers to plants possessing flowers with both the female and male parts.  These include 
tomatoes, beans, lettuce and eggplant.  In contrast, cucumber and squash require cross-pollination 
where wind or insects deliver pollen from male flowers to pollinate female flowers on the same or 
different plants.  
Home gardeners wishing to collect seeds from cross-pollinating plants rely on manual pollination.  To 
begin, select female flowers (they have miniature fruit at their base).  Close each with a rubber band the 
night before it opens.  In the morning transfer the pollen from a male flower to the female, and then 
close the female flower with a rubber band immediately.  Remove the rubber band as fruit grows. 
 
Collecting and Saving Seeds  
Select disease-free plants for seed saving.  Consider traits like: flavor, beauty, size, yield, early or late 
blooming, maturity date, method of pollination and collection.  Collect seeds from several plants and 
fruits throughout the harvest season.  Collect seeds from fully ripe fruit, but not rotten.  For example, 
cucumbers at the edible stage do not have mature seeds. Maturity occurs after the first frost, as it does 
with pumpkins and winter squash.  Collect flower seeds when flowers fade and dry, have dry puffy tops 
or dry seed pods that begin to break open.  
 
The Dry Method: plants with dry seeds include peas, beans, carrots, peppers, and most flowers and 
herbs.  These are best left on the plant until the seeds are dry.  When necessary, pull the whole plant 
and hang upside down or cut the seed pods off and finish drying in the shade.  Use a bag to catch any 
seeds that pop out.  Do not use heat to dry seeds; it damages them. 
 

• Peppers must be red/yellow and shriveled for seed collection.  Wear gloves for hot peppers! 
 
The Wet Method: plants with fleshy fruits like tomatoes are best processed through fermentation. 
Scoop the seeds into a glass, add water, and let sit in a warm place for 3 or more days until a mold film 
develops on the surface.  Pour into a strainer and wash the rotten, fleshy material off the seeds.  Dip the 
seeds in a 20% bleach solution to help protect from some viruses.  After a fresh water rinse, lay the 
seeds out on paper towels to dry.   
• Leave summer squash and cucumbers on plant until skin is yellowish and hard, well past edible. 
• Eggplant seeds are ripe when fruit is brownish & shriveled.  Seeds left in water too long will sprout. 
 
Storing and Using Seeds 
Put dried seeds in envelops labeled with type (e.g. tomato), variety (e.g. Indigo Rose), days to maturity 
and collection date.  Place in a tight-sealing jar and freeze for 2 days to kill pests.  To keep seeds dry, 
place ½ cup of freshly opened powered milk, folded inside tissue, in the jar.  Store in a cool, dark, dry 
place, such as refrigerator or freezer, and protect from insects and rodents.  Bring freezer-stored seeds 
to room temperature before opening.  Legumes prefer a breathable bag. 
Plan to use your seeds within 3 years.  Because seed viability and plant vigor decline over time, expect to 
plant more of older seeds to end up with the number of plants you want. 
 
Potential Pitfalls 
• Don’t collect seeds from hybrids.  Seeds may be sterile or result in plants that do not look like the 
parent.  
• Seeds may carry diseases; dipping in bleach, rinsing, and drying usually helps avoid this problem. 
• Seed production reduces plant vigor; select the best few plants and fruits for saving seeds. 
• Don’t bet the whole garden on just your saved seeds, just in case.

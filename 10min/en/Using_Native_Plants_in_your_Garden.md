# Using Native Plants in Your Garden

### Introduction

The main reasons for using native plants in the garden are their wildlife benefits, their regional aesthetics, and their proven adaptation to the local climate, soil, and ecosystems. That’s why we use native plants for restoration of protected wetlands, river banks, prairies, savannahs, and forests.

This does not mean native plants will automatically do well in our home gardens because these human creations generally differ from the native environment of plants. To succeed, keep in mind the old adage “right plant, right place” and match what the plant requires (soil type and nutrients, sun/shade, moisture, cold/heat tolerance) to what your site offers. Follow established procedures for planting, watering, and pest monitoring. Be sure to give your new plant proper care until it is established.

### Know These Before You Begin

The official government definition of a native plant is:

> “A plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem.”

Therefore, the word *native* should always be used with a geographic qualifier – for example, native to Western US. Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. Many native plants have cultivated varieties selected and cultivated by humans—some originate as mutations on plants; others could be hybrids of two plants. See the **Native Plant Glossary** for more information.

Before you buy a plant, find out its native habitat (such as Douglas fir forest, deciduous forested wetland, etc.). Knowing this helps you determine if the plant fits your garden. The [Portland Plant List](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/citycode/article/322280) is a good resource.

If you have a small lot, pay special attention to mature plant size. A large space is more appropriate for thicket-forming plants with aggressive spreading roots such as snowberry (*Symphoricarpos albus*) and Nootka rose (*Rosa nutkana*).

Clarify your priority:

- For plants that offer food and habitat for birds, get a suggested plant list from the [Audubon Society](https://www.audubon.org/native-plants).
- If feeding pollinators is your focus, check out the research at OSU’s [Garden Ecology Lab](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/gardenecologylab/) for ideas.

## Garden-Worthy Native Plants

Seasoned nursery professionals and garden designers nominated candidates that are of superior aesthetic quality, behave well in the garden, and are available in the nursery trade.

### Small Trees & Shrubs

- **Cascara (*Rhamnus purschiana*)**: Deciduous native Buckthorn, grows to 30-ft as a tree or 15-ft as a multi-stem shrub. Green leaves, grayish bark with white patches, cherry-like fruit. Prefers moist shaded locations.
- **Vine maple (*Acer circinatum*)**: Multi-stemmed deciduous tree, matures at 20-ft high and wide. Grows in full sun to deep shade, but with sun has better fall foliage colors. Drought-tolerant when established.
- **Western serviceberry (*Amelanchier alnifolia*)**: Deciduous tree/shrub to 20-ft. Fragrant white flowers produce edible fruits. Place in sun to part shade in ordinary garden soil. Prefers summer moisture.
- **Coast blue blossom (*Ceanothus thyrsiflorus ‘Oregon Mist’*)**: Grows to 15-ft, with small deep green leaves and soft turquoise flowers in late April to early June. Prune after blooming. Full sun and average well-drained soil. Little to no summer water when established.
- **Silk tassel (*Garrya eliptica*)**: Evergreen shrub to 12-ft high and wide. Female and male plants have catkins (males are more showy). Takes sun or part shade, good drainage, and is drought-tolerant after established.
- **Pacific wax myrtle (*Morella california*)**: Broadleaf evergreen shrub that grows to 10-12-ft. Sun to part shade. Tolerates damp locations and summer drought. Can be sheared into geometric shapes, hedges, or grown as a small tree.
- **Ocean spray (*Holodiscus discolor*)**: Shrub to 10-ft, with graceful arching habit and drooping flower clusters in creamy white during summer. Drought-tolerant and a good choice for sunny woodland gardens, shrub beds, or near buildings.
- **Hairy manzanita (*Arctostaphylos columbiana ‘Wolf Creek’*)**: Evergreen shrub to 8-ft by 8-ft. Gray-green leaves, white flowers in spring, and smooth exfoliating mahogany bark. No summer water. Good for wild areas and dry hillsides.
- **Flowering currant (*Ribes sanguineum*)**: Deciduous multi-stem shrub growing to 8-ft high and wide. Blooms in early spring. Best in a sunny location but will tolerate shade.
- **Evergreen huckleberry (*Vaccinium ovatum*)**: Upright, slow-growing shrub to 8-ft or more. Small white flowers in spring turn into blue-black berries by late summer for jam or jelly. Performs equally well in woodland and full sun. Drought-tolerant after established, but irrigation helps flowering and fruiting.
- **Ground cover manzanita (*Arctostaphylos x media ‘Martha Ewan’*)**: 2-ft high and 6-ft wide evergreen shrub with deep green leaves. White flowers in spring followed by large red berries for wildlife. Full sun in well-drained soils. No summer water when established. Great for sunny slopes.
- **Glossy-leaved Spiraea (*Spiraea betulifolia var. lucida*)**: Low mound of 2-ft high and 3-ft wide. White flowers in late spring. Deciduous leaves have fall colors. Full sun and rich soil. Needs light summer water.

### Perennials and Annuals

- **Sword fern (*Polysticum munitum*)**: Evergreen mound of 3-ft high and wide. Tolerates dry shade.
- **Tufted hairgrass (*Deschampsia caespitosa*)**: Evergreen grass, sun to part shade, to 3-ft high and 2-ft wide. Requires some summer water. Low maintenance.
- **Rose checker mallow (*Sidalcea virgata*)**: Pink to magenta flowers on 2-ft stems. Thrives in rich soil with average summer water. Forms a 2-ft clump over time. Native to heavy clay soils and adapted to no summer water, but irrigation increases bloom quantity and duration.
- **Western columbine (*Aquilegia formosa*)**: Grows to 2-ft, with nodding red blooms. Prefers moist areas in the wild.
- **Deer fern (*Blechnum spicant*)**: Evergreen fronds 2-ft tall. Thrives in light to deep shade, in rich moist soils or well-drained soil with occasional summer water. Tolerates sandy and clay soils.
- **Giant blue-eyed Mary (*Collinsia grandiflora*)**: 20-inch high grassy annual with blue and white small snapdragon flowers from late April to mid-June. Likes open sunny sites. Water to establish.
- **Coast trillium (*Trillium ovatum*)**: Grows to 18-inches high. Requires fertile, humus-rich, well-drained soil in light shade. Young plants can take three years to bloom. Leave old flowers to form seeds—ants will disperse them.
- **Groundcover strawberries (*Fragaria spp.*)**: Includes several species of native strawberries with fruits for wildlife and evergreen foliage. Sun to part shade. Can spread.

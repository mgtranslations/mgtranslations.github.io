Using Native Plants in Your Garden 
Introduction 
The main reasons for using native plants in the garden are their wildlife benefits, their regional aesthetics, and 
their proven adaptation to the local climate, soil, and ecosystems. That’s why we use native plants for 
restoration of protected wetland, river banks, prairies, savannahs, and forests. This does not mean native 
plants will automatically do well in our home gardens because these human creations generally differ from the 
native environment of plants. To succeed, keep in mind the old adage “right plant, right place” and match 
what the plant requires (soil type and nutrients, sun/shade, moisture, cold/heat tolerance) to what your site 
offers. Follow established procedures for planting, watering, and pest monitoring. Be sure to give your new 
plant proper care until it is established.  
 
Know These Before You Begin 
The official government definition of native plant is “A plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has 
developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem.” Therefore, the word 
native should always be used with a geographic qualifier – for example, native to Western US. Only plants 
found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. Many 
native plants have cultivated varieties selected and cultivated by humans -- some originate as mutations on 
plants; others could be hybrids of two plants. See ‘Native Plant Glossary’ for more information. 
 
Before you buy a plant, find out its native habitat (such as Douglas fir forest, deciduous forested wetland, 
etc.). Knowing this helps you determine if the plant fits your garden. Portland Plant List 
https://www.portlandoregon.gov/citycode/article/322280  is a good resource. If you have a small lot, pay 
special attention to mature plant size. A large space is more appropriate for thicket forming plants with 
aggressive spreading roots such as snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) and Nootka rose (Rosa nutkana). 
 
Clarify your priority. For plants that offer food and habitat for birds, get a suggested plant list from the 
Audubon Society https://www.audubon.org/native-plants. If feeding pollinators is your thing, check out the 
research at OSU’s Garden Ecology Lab http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/gardenecologylab/ for ideas. 
 
Garden-Worthy Native Plants 
Seasoned nursery professionals and garden designers nominated candidates that are of superior aesthetic 
quality, behave well in the garden, and are available in the nursery trade.  
 
Small Trees & Shrubs 
Cascara (Rhamnus purschiana) is a deciduous native Buckthorn, to 30-ft as a tree or 15-ft as a multi-stem 
shrub, green leaves, grayish bark with white patches, cherry-like fruit, likes moist shaded locations. 
Vine maple (Acer circinatum) is a multi-stemmed deciduous tree that matures at 20-ft high and wide, grows in 
full sun to deep shade but with sun has better fall foliage colors, drought tolerant when established. 
Western serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia) is a deciduous tree/shrub to 20-ft, fragrant white flowers 
produce edible fruits, place in sun to part shade in ordinary garden soil, prefers summer moisture. 
Coast blue blossom (Ceanothus thyrsiflorus ‘Oregon Mist’) grows to 15-ft, with small deep green leaves and 
soft turquoise flowers in late April to early June, prune after blooming, full sun and average well drained soil, 
little to no summer water when established. 
 

Silk tassel (Garrya eliptica) is an evergreen shrub to 12-ft high and wide, female and male plants have catkins, 
(males are more showy), takes sun or part-shade, good drainage, and is drought-tolerant after established. 
Pacific wax myrtle (Morella california) is a broadleaf evergreen shrub that grows to 10-12-ft, sun to part 
shade, tolerates damp locations and summer drought, can be sheared into geometric shapes, hedge, or grown 
as a small tree.  
Ocean spray (Holodiscus discolor) is a shrub, to 10-ft, with graceful arching habit, drooping flower clusters in 
creamy-white in the summer, drought-tolerant and a good choice for a sunny woodland garden, near the back 
of a shrub bed, or next to a building. 
Hairy manzanita (Arctostaphylos columbiana ‘Wolf Creek’) is an evergreen shrub, to 8-ft by 8-ft, with gray 
green leaves, white flowers in spring, and smooth exfoliating mahogany bark, no summer water, good for wild 
areas and dry hillsides.  
Flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum) is a deciduous multi-stem shrub growing to 8-ft high and wide, blooms 
in early spring, and best in a sunny location but will tolerate shade. 
Evergreen huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum) is an upright, slow-growing shrub to 8-ft or more, small white 
flowers in spring turn into blue-black berries by late summer for jam or jelly, performs equally well in the 
woodland and full sun, drought-tolerant after established but irrigation helps flowering and fruiting. 
Ground cover manzanita (Arctostaphylos x media ‘Martha Ewan’) is a 2-ft high and 6-ft wide evergreen shrub 
with deep green leaves, white flowers in spring followed by large red berries for wild life, full sun in well 
drained soils, no summer water when established, great for sunny slopes.  
Glossy-leaved Spiraea (Spiraea betulifolia var. lucida) is a low mound of 2-ft high and 3-ft wide, white flowers 
in late spring, deciduous leaves have fall colors, full sun and rich soil, needs light summer water. 
 
Perennials and Annuals 
Sword fern (Polysticum munitum) an evergreen mound of 3-ft high and wide, tolerates dry shade. 
Tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa) evergreen grass, sun to part-shade, to 3-ft high and 2-ft wide, 
some summer water, low maintenance.  
Rose checker mallow (Sidalcea virgata) grows pink to magenta flowers on 2-ft stems, thrives in rich soil with 
average summer water, and forms a 2-ft clump over time. Native to heavy clay soils and adapted to no 
summer water, but irrigation increases bloom quantity and duration. 
Western columbine (Aquilegia formosa) to 2-ft, with nodding red blooms, prefers moist areas in the wild. 
Deer fern (Blechnum spicant) offers evergreen fronds 2-feet tall, in light to deep shade, in rich moist soils or 
well drained soil with occasional summer water, tolerates sandy and clay soils. 
Giant blue-eyed Mary (Collinsia grandiflora) 20-inches high grassy annual that makes a cloud of blue and 
white small snapdragon flowers from late April to mid-June, likes open sunny sites, water to establish. 
Coast trillium (Trillium ovatum) grows to 18-inches high, requires fertile, humus-rich, well-drained soil in light 
shade, young plants can take three years to bloom, leave old flowers to form seeds -- ants will disperse them. 
Groundcover strawberries (Fragaria spp.) include several species of native strawberries with fruits for wildlife 
and evergreen foliage, sun to part-shade, can spread.
